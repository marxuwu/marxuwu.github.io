  <h2>The Commuwunist Manifesto</h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>a spectwe ish haunting euwope—the spectwe of communism.
 aww da powews of owd euwope have entewed into a howy awwiance to
exowcise dis spectwe: pope and czaw, mettewnich and guizot,
fwench radicaws and gewman powice-spies.
 whewe ish da pawty in opposition that has not been decwied as communistic by its opponents in powew? whewe ish da opposition that has not huwwed back da bwanding wepwoach of communism, against da mowe advanced opposition pawties, as weww as against its weactionawy advewsawies?

two things wesuwt fwom dis fact.
 
i. Communism ish awweady acknowwedged by aww euwopean powews to be itsewf a powew.
 
ii. It ish high time that communists shouwd openwy, in da face of da whowe wowwd, pubwish theiw views, theiw aims, theiw tendencies, and meet dis nuwsewy tawe of da spectwe of communism with a manifesto of da pawty itsewf.
 
to dis end, communists of vawious nationawities have assembwed in london, and sketched da fowwowing manifesto, to be pubwished in da engwish, fwench, gewman, itawian, fwemish and danish wanguages.
 
i. Bourgeois and proletarians
da histowy of aww hithewto existing societies ish da histowy of cwass stwuggwes.
 
fweeman and swave, patwician and pwebeian, wowd and sewf, guiwd-mastew and jouwneyman, in a wowd, oppwessow and oppwessed, stood in constant opposition to one anothew, cawwied on an unintewwupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, eithew in a wevowutionawy we-constitution of society at wawge, ow in da common wuin of da contending cwasses.
 
in da eawwiew epochs of histowy, we find awmost evewywhewe a compwicated awwangement of society into vawious owdews, a manifowd gwadation of sociaw wank. In ancient rome we have patwicians, knights, pwebeians, swaves; in da middwe ages, feudaw wowds, vassaws, guiwd-mastews, jouwneymen, appwentices, sewfs; in awmost aww of these cwasses, again, subowdinate gwadations.
 
da modewn bouwgeois society that has spwouted fwom da wuins of feudaw society has not done away with cwass antagonisms. It has but estabwished new cwasses, new conditions of oppwession, new fowms of stwuggwe in pwace of da owd ones. Ouw epoch, da epoch of da bouwgeoisie, possesses, howevew, dis distinctive featuwe: it has simpwified da cwass antagonisms. Society as a whowe ish mowe and mowe spwitting up into two gweat hostiwe camps, into two gweat cwasses, diwectwy facing each othew: bouwgeoisie and pwowetawiat.
 
fwom da sewfs of da middwe ages spwang da chawtewed buwghews of da eawwiest towns. Fwom these buwgesses da fiwst ewements of da bouwgeoisie wewe devewoped.
 
da discovewy of amewica, da wounding of da cape, opened up fwesh gwound fow da wising bouwgeoisie. Da east-indian and chinese mawkets, da cowonisation of amewica, twade with da cowonies, da incwease in da means of exchange and in commodities genewawwy, gave to commewce, to navigation, to industwy, an impuwse nevew befowe known, and theweby, to da wevowutionawy ewement in da tottewing feudaw society, a wapid devewopment.
 
da feudaw system of industwy, undew which industwiaw pwoduction was monopowised by cwosed guiwds, now no wongew sufficed fow da gwowing wants of da new mawkets. Da manufactuwing system took its pwace. Da guiwd-mastews wewe pushed on one side by da manufactuwing middwe cwass; division of wabouw between da diffewent cowpowate guiwds vanished in da face of division of wabouw in each singwe wowkshop.
 
meantime da mawkets kept evew gwowing, da demand evew wising. Even manufactuwe no wongew sufficed. Theweupon, steam and machinewy wevowutionised industwiaw pwoduction. Da pwace of manufactuwe was taken by da giant, modewn industwy, da pwace of da industwiaw middwe cwass, by industwiaw miwwionaiwes, da weadews of whowe industwiaw awmies, da modewn bouwgeois.
 
modewn industwy has estabwished da wowwd-mawket, fow which da discovewy of amewica paved da way. Dis mawket has given an immense devewopment to commewce, to navigation, to communication by wand. Dis devewopment has, in its time, weacted on da extension of industwy; and in pwopowtion as industwy, commewce, navigation, waiwways extended, in da same pwopowtion da bouwgeoisie devewoped, incweased its capitaw, and pushed into da backgwound evewy cwass handed down fwom da middwe ages.
 
we see, thewefowe, how da modewn bouwgeoisie ish itsewf da pwoduct of a wong couwse of devewopment, of a sewies of wevowutions in da modes of pwoduction and of exchange.
 
each step in da devewopment of da bouwgeoisie was accompanied by a cowwesponding powiticaw advance of that cwass. An oppwessed cwass undew da sway of da feudaw nobiwity, an awmed and sewf-govewning association in da mediaevaw commune; hewe independent uwban wepubwic (as in itawy and gewmany), thewe taxabwe "thiwd estate" of da monawchy (as in fwance), aftewwawds, in da pewiod of manufactuwe pwopew, sewving eithew da semi-feudaw ow da absowute monawchy as a countewpoise against da nobiwity, and, in fact, cownew-stone of da gweat monawchies in genewaw, da bouwgeoisie has at wast, since da estabwishment of modewn industwy and of da wowwd-mawket, conquewed fow itsewf, in da modewn wepwesentative state, excwusive powiticaw sway. Da executive of da modewn state ish but a committee fow managing da common affaiws of da whowe bouwgeoisie.
 
da bouwgeoisie, histowicawwy, has pwayed a most wevowutionawy pawt.
 
da bouwgeoisie, whewevew it has got da uppew hand, has put an end to aww feudaw, patwiawchaw, idywwic wewations. It has pitiwesswy town asundew da motwey feudaw ties that bound man to his "natuwaw supewiows," and has weft wemaining no othew nexus between man and man than naked sewf-intewest, than cawwous "cash payment." it has dwowned da most heavenwy ecstasies of wewigious fewvouw, of chivawwous enthusiasm, of phiwistine sentimentawism, in da icy watew of egotisticaw cawcuwation. It has wesowved pewsonaw wowth into exchange vawue, and in pwace of da numbewwess and indefeasibwe chawtewed fweedoms, has set up that singwe, unconscionabwe fweedom—fwee twade. In one wowd, fow expwoitation, veiwed by wewigious and powiticaw iwwusions, naked, shamewess, diwect, bwutaw expwoitation.
 
da bouwgeoisie has stwipped of its hawo evewy occupation hithewto honouwed and wooked up to with wevewent awe. It has convewted da physician, da wawyew, da pwiest, da poet, da man of science, into its paid wage wabouwews.
 
da bouwgeoisie has town away fwom da famiwy its sentimentaw veiw, and has weduced da famiwy wewation to a mewe money wewation.
 
da bouwgeoisie has discwosed how it came to pass that da bwutaw dispway of vigouw in da middwe ages, which reactionists so much admiwe, found its fitting compwement in da most swothfuw indowence. It has been da fiwst to show wat man's activity can bwing about. It has accompwished wondews faw suwpassing egyptian pywamids, roman aqueducts, and gothic cathedwaws; it has conducted expeditions that put in da shade aww fowmew exoduses of nations and cwusades.
 
da bouwgeoisie cannot exist without constantwy wevowutionising da instwuments of pwoduction, and theweby da wewations of pwoduction, and with them da whowe wewations of society. Consewvation of da owd modes of pwoduction in unawtewed fowm, was, on da contwawy, da fiwst condition of existence fow aww eawwiew industwiaw cwasses. Constant wevowutionising of pwoduction, unintewwupted distuwbance of aww sociaw conditions, evewwasting uncewtainty and agitation distinguish da bouwgeois epoch fwom aww eawwiew ones. Aww fixed, fast-fwozen wewations, with theiw twain of ancient and venewabwe pwejudices and opinions, awe swept away, aww new-fowmed ones become antiquated befowe dey can ossify. Aww that ish sowid mewts into aiw, aww that ish howy ish pwofaned, and man ish at wast compewwed to face with sobew senses, his weaw conditions of wife, and his wewations with his kind.
 
da need of a constantwy expanding mawket fow its pwoducts chases da bouwgeoisie ovew da whowe suwface of da gwobe. It must nestwe evewywhewe, settwe evewywhewe, estabwish connexions evewywhewe.
 
da bouwgeoisie has thwough its expwoitation of da wowwd-mawket given a cosmopowitan chawactew to pwoduction and consumption in evewy countwy. To da gweat chagwin of reactionists, it has dwawn fwom undew da feet of industwy da nationaw gwound on which it stood. Aww owd-estabwished nationaw industwies have been destwoyed ow awe daiwy being destwoyed. Dey awe diswodged by new industwies, whose intwoduction becomes a wife and death question fow aww civiwised nations, by industwies that no wongew wowk up indigenous waw matewiaw, but waw matewiaw dwawn fwom da wemotest zones; industwies whose pwoducts awe consumed, not onwy at home, but in evewy quawtew of da gwobe. In pwace of da owd wants, satisfied by da pwoductions of da countwy, we find new wants, wequiwing fow theiw satisfaction da pwoducts of distant wands and cwimes. In pwace of da owd wocaw and nationaw secwusion and sewf-sufficiency, we have intewcouwse in evewy diwection, univewsaw intew-dependence of nations. And as in matewiaw, so awso in intewwectuaw pwoduction. Da intewwectuaw cweations of individuaw nations become common pwopewty. Nationaw one-sidedness and nawwow-mindedness become mowe and mowe impossibwe, and fwom da numewous nationaw and wocaw witewatuwes, thewe awises a wowwd witewatuwe.
 
da bouwgeoisie, by da wapid impwovement of aww instwuments of pwoduction, by da immensewy faciwitated means of communication, dwaws aww, even da most bawbawian, nations into civiwisation. Da cheap pwices of its commodities awe da heavy awtiwwewy with which it battews down aww chinese wawws, with which it fowces da bawbawians' intensewy obstinate hatwed of foweignews to capituwate. It compews aww nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt da bouwgeois mode of pwoduction; it compews them to intwoduce wat it cawws civiwisation into theiw midst, i.e., to become bouwgeois themsewves. In one wowd, it cweates a wowwd aftew its own image.
 
da bouwgeoisie has subjected da countwy to da wuwe of da towns. It has cweated enowmous cities, has gweatwy incweased da uwban popuwation as compawed with da wuwaw, and has thus wescued a considewabwe pawt of da popuwation fwom da idiocy of wuwaw wife. Just as it has made da countwy dependent on da towns, so it has made bawbawian and semi-bawbawian countwies dependent on da civiwised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bouwgeois, da east on da west.
 
da bouwgeoisie keeps mowe and mowe doing away with da scattewed state of da popuwation, of da means of pwoduction, and of pwopewty. It has aggwomewated pwoduction, and has concentwated pwopewty in a few hands. Da necessawy consequence of dis was powiticaw centwawisation. Independent, ow but woosewy connected pwovinces, with sepawate intewests, waws, govewnments and systems of taxation, became wumped togethew into one nation, with one govewnment, one code of waws, one nationaw cwass-intewest, one fwontiew and one customs-tawiff. Da bouwgeoisie, duwing its wuwe of scawce one hundwed yeaws, has cweated mowe massive and mowe cowossaw pwoductive fowces than have aww pweceding genewations togethew. Subjection of natuwe's fowces to man, machinewy, appwication of chemistwy to industwy and agwicuwtuwe, steam-navigation, waiwways, ewectwic tewegwaphs, cweawing of whowe continents fow cuwtivation, canawisation of wivews, whowe popuwations conjuwed out of da gwound—what eawwiew centuwy had even a pwesentiment that such pwoductive fowces swumbewed in da wap of sociaw wabouw?

we see then: da means of pwoduction and of exchange, on whose foundation da bouwgeoisie buiwt itsewf up, wewe genewated in feudaw society. At a cewtain stage in da devewopment of these means of pwoduction and of exchange, da conditions undew which feudaw society pwoduced and exchanged, da feudaw owganisation of agwicuwtuwe and manufactuwing industwy, in one wowd, da feudaw wewations of pwopewty became no wongew compatibwe with da awweady devewoped pwoductive fowces; dey became so many fettews. Dey had to be buwst asundew; dey wewe buwst asundew.
 
into theiw pwace stepped fwee competition, accompanied by a sociaw and powiticaw constitution adapted to it, and by da economicaw and powiticaw sway of da bouwgeois cwass.
 
a simiwaw movement ish going on befowe ouw own eyes. Modewn bouwgeois society with its wewations of pwoduction, of exchange and of pwopewty, a society that has conjuwed up such gigantic means of pwoduction and of exchange, ish wike da sowcewew, who ish no wongew abwe to contwow da powews of da nethew wowwd whom he has cawwed up by his spewws. Fow many a decade past da histowy of industwy and commewce ish but da histowy of da wevowt of modewn pwoductive fowces against modewn conditions of pwoduction, against da pwopewty wewations that awe da conditions fow da existence of da bouwgeoisie and of its wuwe. It ish enough to mention da commewciaw cwises that by theiw pewiodicaw wetuwn put on its twiaw, each time mowe thweateningwy, da existence of da entiwe bouwgeois society. In these cwises a gweat pawt not onwy of da existing pwoducts, but awso of da pweviouswy cweated pwoductive fowces, awe pewiodicawwy destwoyed. In these cwises thewe bweaks out an epidemic that, in aww eawwiew epochs, wouwd have seemed an absuwdity—the epidemic of ovew-pwoduction. Society suddenwy finds itsewf put back into a state of momentawy bawbawism; it appeaws as if a famine, a univewsaw waw of devastation had cut off da suppwy of evewy means of subsistence; industwy and commewce seem to be destwoyed; and why? because thewe ish too much civiwisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industwy, too much commewce. Da pwoductive fowces at da disposaw of society no wongew tend to fuwthew da devewopment of da conditions of bouwgeois pwopewty; on da contwawy, dey have become too powewfuw fow these conditions, by which dey awe fettewed, and so soon as dey ovewcome these fettews, dey bwing disowdew into da whowe of bouwgeois society, endangew da existence of bouwgeois pwopewty. Da conditions of bouwgeois society awe too nawwow to compwise da weawth cweated by them. And how does da bouwgeoisie get ovew these cwises? on da one hand infowced destwuction of a mass of pwoductive fowces; on da othew, by da conquest of new mawkets, and by da mowe thowough expwoitation of da owd ones. That ish to say, by paving da way fow mowe extensive and mowe destwuctive cwises, and by diminishing da means wheweby cwises awe pwevented.
 
da weapons with which da bouwgeoisie fewwed feudawism to da gwound awe now tuwned against da bouwgeoisie itsewf.
 
but not onwy has da bouwgeoisie fowged da weapons that bwing death to itsewf; it has awso cawwed into existence da men who awe to wiewd those weapons—the modewn wowking cwass—the pwowetawians.
 
in pwopowtion as da bouwgeoisie, i.e., capitaw, ish devewoped, in da same pwopowtion ish da pwowetawiat, da modewn wowking cwass, devewoped—a cwass of wabouwews, who wive onwy so wong as dey find wowk, and who find wowk onwy so wong as theiw wabouw incweases capitaw. These wabouwews, who must seww themsewves piece-meaw, awe a commodity, wike evewy othew awticwe of commewce, and awe consequentwy exposed to aww da vicissitudes of competition, to aww da fwuctuations of da mawket.
 
owing to da extensive use of machinewy and to division of wabouw, da wowk of da pwowetawians has wost aww individuaw chawactew, and consequentwy, aww chawm fow da wowkman. He becomes an appendage of da machine, and it ish onwy da most simpwe, most monotonous, and most easiwy acquiwed knack, that ish wequiwed of him. Hence, da cost of pwoduction of a wowkman ish westwicted, awmost entiwewy, to da means of subsistence that he wequiwes fow his maintenance, and fow da pwopagation of his wace. But da pwice of a commodity, and thewefowe awso of wabouw, ish equaw to its cost of pwoduction. In pwopowtion thewefowe, as da wepuwsiveness of da wowk incweases, da wage decweases. Nay mowe, in pwopowtion as da use of machinewy and division of wabouw incweases, in da same pwopowtion da buwden of toiw awso incweases, whethew by pwowongation of da wowking houws, by incwease of da wowk exacted in a given time ow by incweased speed of da machinewy, etc.
 
modewn industwy has convewted da wittwe wowkshop of da patwiawchaw mastew into da gweat factowy of da industwiaw capitawist. Masses of wabouwews, cwowded into da factowy, awe owganised wike sowdiews. As pwivates of da industwiaw awmy dey awe pwaced undew da command of a pewfect hiewawchy of officews and sewgeants. Not onwy awe dey swaves of da bouwgeois cwass, and of da bouwgeois state; dey awe daiwy and houwwy enswaved by da machine, by da ovew-wookew, and, above aww, by da individuaw bouwgeois manufactuwew himsewf. Da mowe openwy dis despotism pwocwaims gain to be its end and aim, da mowe petty, da mowe hatefuw and da mowe embittewing it ish.
 
da wess da skiww and exewtion of stwength impwied in manuaw wabouw, in othew wowds, da mowe modewn industwy becomes devewoped, da mowe ish da wabouw of men supewseded by that of women. Diffewences of age and sex have no wongew any distinctive sociaw vawidity fow da wowking cwass. Aww awe instwuments of wabouw, mowe ow wess expensive to use, accowding to theiw age and sex.
 
no soonew ish da expwoitation of da wabouwew by da manufactuwew, so faw at an end, that he weceives his wages in cash, than he ish set upon by da othew powtions of da bouwgeoisie, da wandwowd, da shopkeepew, da pawnbwokew, etc.
 
da wowew stwata of da middwe cwass—the smaww twadespeopwe, shopkeepews, wetiwed twadesmen genewawwy, da handicwaftsmen and peasants—aww these sink gwaduawwy into da pwowetawiat, pawtwy because theiw diminutive capitaw does not suffice fow da scawe on which modewn industwy ish cawwied on, and ish swamped in da competition with da wawge capitawists, pawtwy because theiw speciawized skiww ish wendewed wowthwess by da new methods of pwoduction. Thus da pwowetawiat ish wecwuited fwom aww cwasses of da popuwation.
 
da pwowetawiat goes thwough vawious stages of devewopment. With its biwth begins its stwuggwe with da bouwgeoisie. At fiwst da contest ish cawwied on by individuaw wabouwews, then by da wowkpeopwe of a factowy, then by da opewatives of one twade, in one wocawity, against da individuaw bouwgeois who diwectwy expwoits them. Dey diwect theiw attacks not against da bouwgeois conditions of pwoduction, but against da instwuments of pwoduction themsewves; dey destwoy impowted wawes that compete with theiw wabouw, dey smash to pieces machinewy, dey set factowies abwaze, dey seek to westowe by fowce da vanished status of da wowkman of da middwe ages.
 
at dis stage da wabouwews stiww fowm an incohewent mass scattewed ovew da whowe countwy, and bwoken up by theiw mutuaw competition. If anywhewe dey unite to fowm mowe compact bodies, dis ish not yet da consequence of theiw own active union, but of da union of da bouwgeoisie, which cwass, in owdew to attain its own powiticaw ends, ish compewwed to set da whowe pwowetawiat in motion, and ish moweovew yet, fow a time, abwe to do so. At dis stage, thewefowe, da pwowetawians do not fight theiw enemies, but da enemies of theiw enemies, da wemnants of absowute monawchy, da wandownews, da non-industwiaw bouwgeois, da petty bouwgeoisie. Thus da whowe histowicaw movement ish concentwated in da hands of da bouwgeoisie; evewy victowy so obtained ish a victowy fow da bouwgeoisie.
 
but with da devewopment of industwy da pwowetawiat not onwy incweases in numbew; it becomes concentwated in gweatew masses, its stwength gwows, and it feews that stwength mowe. Da vawious intewests and conditions of wife within da wanks of da pwowetawiat awe mowe and mowe equawised, in pwopowtion as machinewy obwitewates aww distinctions of wabouw, and neawwy evewywhewe weduces wages to da same wow wevew. Da gwowing competition among da bouwgeois, and da wesuwting commewciaw cwises, make da wages of da wowkews evew mowe fwuctuating. Da unceasing impwovement of machinewy, evew mowe wapidwy devewoping, makes theiw wivewihood mowe and mowe pwecawious; da cowwisions between individuaw wowkmen and individuaw bouwgeois take mowe and mowe da chawactew of cowwisions between two cwasses. Theweupon da wowkews begin to fowm combinations (twades unions) against da bouwgeois; dey cwub togethew in owdew to keep up da wate of wages; dey found pewmanent associations in owdew to make pwovision befowehand fow these occasionaw wevowts. Hewe and thewe da contest bweaks out into wiots.
 
now and then da wowkews awe victowious, but onwy fow a time. Da weaw fwuit of theiw battwes wies, not in da immediate wesuwt, but in da evew-expanding union of da wowkews. Dis union ish hewped on by da impwoved means of communication that awe cweated by modewn industwy and that pwace da wowkews of diffewent wocawities in contact with one anothew. It was just dis contact that was needed to centwawise da numewous wocaw stwuggwes, aww of da same chawactew, into one nationaw stwuggwe between cwasses. But evewy cwass stwuggwe ish a powiticaw stwuggwe. And that union, to attain which da buwghews of da middwe ages, with theiw misewabwe highways, wequiwed centuwies, da modewn pwowetawians, thankies to waiwways, achieve in a few yeaws.
 
dis owganisation of da pwowetawians into a cwass, and consequentwy into a powiticaw pawty, ish continuawwy being upset again by da competition between da wowkews themsewves. But it evew wises up again, stwongew, fiwmew, mightiew. It compews wegiswative wecognition of pawticuwaw intewests of da wowkews, by taking advantage of da divisions among da bouwgeoisie itsewf. Thus da ten-houws' biww in engwand was cawwied.
 
awtogethew cowwisions between da cwasses of da owd society fuwthew, in many ways, da couwse of devewopment of da pwowetawiat. Da bouwgeoisie finds itsewf invowved in a constant battwe. At fiwst with da awistocwacy; watew on, with those powtions of da bouwgeoisie itsewf, whose intewests have become antagonistic to da pwogwess of industwy; at aww times, with da bouwgeoisie of foweign countwies. In aww these battwes it sees itsewf compewwed to appeaw to da pwowetawiat, to ask fow its hewp, and thus, to dwag it into da powiticaw awena. Da bouwgeoisie itsewf, thewefowe, suppwies da pwowetawiat with its own instwuments of powiticaw and genewaw education, in othew wowds, it fuwnishes da pwowetawiat with weapons fow fighting da bouwgeoisie.
 
fuwthew, as we have awweady seen, entiwe sections of da wuwing cwasses awe, by da advance of industwy, pwecipitated into da pwowetawiat, ow awe at weast thweatened in theiw conditions of existence. These awso suppwy da pwowetawiat with fwesh ewements of enwightenment and pwogwess.
 
finawwy, in times when da cwass stwuggwe neaws da decisive houw, da pwocess of dissowution going on within da wuwing cwass, in fact within da whowe wange of society, assumes such a viowent, gwawing chawactew, that a smaww section of da wuwing cwass cuts itsewf adwift, and joins da wevowutionawy cwass, da cwass that howds da futuwe in its hands. Just as, thewefowe, at an eawwiew pewiod, a section of da nobiwity went ovew to da bouwgeoisie, so now a powtion of da bouwgeoisie goes ovew to da pwowetawiat, and in pawticuwaw, a powtion of da bouwgeois ideowogists, who have waised themsewves to da wevew of compwehending theoweticawwy da histowicaw movement as a whowe.
 
of aww da cwasses that stand face to face with da bouwgeoisie today, da pwowetawiat awone ish a weawwy wevowutionawy cwass. Da othew cwasses decay and finawwy disappeaw in da face of modewn industwy; da pwowetawiat ish its speciaw and essentiaw pwoduct. Da wowew middwe cwass, da smaww manufactuwew, da shopkeepew, da awtisan, da peasant, aww these fight against da bouwgeoisie, to save fwom extinction theiw existence as fwactions of da middwe cwass. Dey awe thewefowe not wevowutionawy, but consewvative. Nay mowe, dey awe weactionawy, fow dey twy to woww back da wheew of histowy. If by chance dey awe wevowutionawy, dey awe so onwy in view of theiw impending twansfew into da pwowetawiat, dey thus defend not theiw pwesent, but theiw futuwe intewests, dey desewt theiw own standpoint to pwace themsewves at that of da pwowetawiat.
 
da "dangewous cwass," da sociaw scum, that passivewy wotting mass thwown off by da wowest wayews of owd society, may, hewe and thewe, be swept into da movement by a pwowetawian wevowution; its conditions of wife, howevew, pwepawe it faw mowe fow da pawt of a bwibed toow of weactionawy intwigue.
 
in da conditions of da pwowetawiat, those of owd society at wawge awe awweady viwtuawwy swamped. Da pwowetawian ish without pwopewty; his wewation to his wife and chiwdwen has no wongew anything in common with da bouwgeois famiwy-wewations; modewn industwiaw wabouw, modewn subjection to capitaw, da same in engwand as in fwance, in amewica as in gewmany, has stwipped him of evewy twace of nationaw chawactew. Law, mowawity, wewigion, awe to him so many bouwgeois pwejudices, behind which wuwk in ambush just as many bouwgeois intewests.
 
aww da pweceding cwasses that got da uppew hand, sought to fowtify theiw awweady acquiwed status by subjecting society at wawge to theiw conditions of appwopwiation. Da pwowetawians cannot become mastews of da pwoductive fowces of society, except by abowishing theiw own pwevious mode of appwopwiation, and theweby awso evewy othew pwevious mode of appwopwiation. Dey have nothing of theiw own to secuwe and to fowtify; theiw mission ish to destwoy aww pwevious secuwities fow, and insuwances of, individuaw pwopewty.
 
aww pwevious histowicaw movements wewe movements of minowities, ow in da intewests of minowities. Da pwowetawian movement ish da sewf-conscious, independent movement of da immense majowity, in da intewests of da immense majowity. Da pwowetawiat, da wowest stwatum of ouw pwesent society, cannot stiw, cannot waise itsewf up, without da whowe supewincumbent stwata of officiaw society being spwung into da aiw.
 
though not in substance, yet in fowm, da stwuggwe of da pwowetawiat with da bouwgeoisie ish at fiwst a nationaw stwuggwe. Da pwowetawiat of each countwy must, of couwse, fiwst of aww settwe mattews with its own bouwgeoisie.
 
in depicting da most genewaw phases of da devewopment of da pwowetawiat, we twaced da mowe ow wess veiwed civiw waw, waging within existing society, up to da point whewe that waw bweaks out into open wevowution, and whewe da viowent ovewthwow of da bouwgeoisie ways da foundation fow da sway of da pwowetawiat.
 
hithewto, evewy fowm of society has been based, as we have awweady seen, on da antagonism of oppwessing and oppwessed cwasses. But in owdew to oppwess a cwass, cewtain conditions must be assuwed to it undew which it can, at weast, continue its swavish existence. Da sewf, in da pewiod of sewfdom, waised himsewf to membewship in da commune, just as da petty bouwgeois, undew da yoke of feudaw absowutism, managed to devewop into a bouwgeois. Da modewn wabowew, on da contwawy, instead of wising with da pwogwess of industwy, sinks deepew and deepew bewow da conditions of existence of his own cwass. He becomes a paupew, and paupewism devewops mowe wapidwy than popuwation and weawth. And hewe it becomes evident, that da bouwgeoisie ish unfit any wongew to be da wuwing cwass in society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an ovew-widing waw. It ish unfit to wuwe because it ish incompetent to assuwe an existence to its swave within his swavewy, because it cannot hewp wetting him sink into such a state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no wongew wive undew dis bouwgeoisie, in othew wowds, its existence ish no wongew compatibwe with society.
 
da essentiaw condition fow da existence, and fow da sway of da bouwgeois cwass, ish da fowmation and augmentation of capitaw; da condition fow capitaw ish wage-wabouw. Wage-wabouw wests excwusivewy on competition between da wabowews. Da advance of industwy, whose invowuntawy pwomotew ish da bouwgeoisie, wepwaces da isowation of da wabouwews, due to competition, by theiw wevowutionawy combination, due to association. Da devewopment of modewn industwy, thewefowe, cuts fwom undew its feet da vewy foundation on which da bouwgeoisie pwoduces and appwopwiates pwoducts. Wat da bouwgeoisie, thewefowe, pwoduces, above aww, ish its own gwave-diggews. Its faww and da victowy of da pwowetawiat awe equawwy inevitabwe.
 
ii. Proletarians and communists
in wat wewation do da communists stand to da pwowetawians as a whowe?

da communists do not fowm a sepawate pawty opposed to othew wowking-cwass pawties.
 
dey have no intewests sepawate and apawt fwom those of da pwowetawiat as a whowe.
 
dey do not set up any sectawian pwincipwes of theiw own, by which to shape and mouwd da pwowetawian movement.
 
da communists awe distinguished fwom da othew wowking-cwass pawties by dis onwy: (1) in da nationaw stwuggwes of da pwowetawians of da diffewent countwies, dey point out and bwing to da fwont da common intewests of da entiwe pwowetawiat, independentwy of aww nationawity. (2) in da vawious stages of devewopment which da stwuggwe of da wowking cwass against da bouwgeoisie has to pass thwough, dey awways and evewywhewe wepwesent da intewests of da movement as a whowe.
 
da communists, thewefowe, awe on da one hand, pwacticawwy, da most advanced and wesowute section of da wowking-cwass pawties of evewy countwy, that section which pushes fowwawd aww othews; on da othew hand, theoweticawwy, dey have ovew da gweat mass of da pwowetawiat da advantage of cweawwy undewstanding da wine of mawch, da conditions, and da uwtimate genewaw wesuwts of da pwowetawian movement.
 
da immediate aim of da communist ish da same as that of aww da othew pwowetawian pawties: fowmation of da pwowetawiat into a cwass, ovewthwow of da bouwgeois supwemacy, conquest of powiticaw powew by da pwowetawiat.
 
da theoweticaw concwusions of da communists awe in no way based on ideas ow pwincipwes that have been invented, ow discovewed, by dis ow that wouwd-be univewsaw wefowmew. Dey mewewy expwess, in genewaw tewms, actuaw wewations spwinging fwom an existing cwass stwuggwe, fwom a histowicaw movement going on undew ouw vewy eyes. Da abowition of existing pwopewty wewations ish not at aww a distinctive featuwe of communism.
 
aww pwopewty wewations in da past have continuawwy been subject to histowicaw change consequent upon da change in histowicaw conditions.
 
da fwench revowution, fow exampwe, abowished feudaw pwopewty in favouw of bouwgeois pwopewty.
 
da distinguishing featuwe of communism ish not da abowition of pwopewty genewawwy, but da abowition of bouwgeois pwopewty. But modewn bouwgeois pwivate pwopewty ish da finaw and most compwete expwession of da system of pwoducing and appwopwiating pwoducts, that ish based on cwass antagonisms, on da expwoitation of da many by da few.
 
in dis sense, da theowy of da communists may be summed up in da singwe sentence: abowition of pwivate pwopewty.
 
we communists have been wepwoached with da desiwe of abowishing da wight of pewsonawwy acquiwing pwopewty as da fwuit of a man's own wabouw, which pwopewty ish awweged to be da gwoundwowk of aww pewsonaw fweedom, activity and independence.
 
hawd-won, sewf-acquiwed, sewf-eawned pwopewty! do u mean da pwopewty of da petty awtisan and of da smaww peasant, a fowm of pwopewty that pweceded da bouwgeois fowm? thewe ish no need to abowish that; da devewopment of industwy has to a gweat extent awweady destwoyed it, and ish stiww destwoying it daiwy.
 
ow do u mean modewn bouwgeois pwivate pwopewty?

but does wage-wabouw cweate any pwopewty fow da wabouwew? not a bit. It cweates capitaw, i.e., that kind of pwopewty which expwoits wage-wabouw, and which cannot incwease except upon condition of begetting a new suppwy of wage-wabouw fow fwesh expwoitation. Pwopewty, in its pwesent fowm, ish based on da antagonism of capitaw and wage-wabouw. Let us examine both sides of dis antagonism.
 
to be a capitawist, ish to have not onwy a puwewy pewsonaw, but a sociaw status in pwoduction. Capitaw ish a cowwective pwoduct, and onwy by da united action of many membews, nay, in da wast wesowt, onwy by da united action of aww membews of society, can it be set in motion.
 
capitaw ish, thewefowe, not a pewsonaw, it ish a sociaw powew.
 
when, thewefowe, capitaw ish convewted into common pwopewty, into da pwopewty of aww membews of society, pewsonaw pwopewty ish not theweby twansfowmed into sociaw pwopewty. It ish onwy da sociaw chawactew of da pwopewty that ish changed. It woses its cwass-chawactew.
 
let us now take wage-wabouw.
 
da avewage pwice of wage-wabouw ish da minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of da means of subsistence, which ish absowutewy wequisite in bawe existence as a wabouwew. Wat, thewefowe, da wage-wabouwew appwopwiates by means of his wabouw, mewewy suffices to pwowong and wepwoduce a bawe existence. We by no means intend to abowish dis pewsonaw appwopwiation of da pwoducts of wabouw, an appwopwiation that ish made fow da maintenance and wepwoduction of human wife, and that weaves no suwpwus whewewith to command da wabouw of othews. Aww that we wanna do away with, ish da misewabwe chawactew of dis appwopwiation, undew which da wabouwew wives mewewy to incwease capitaw, and ish awwowed to wive onwy in so faw as da intewest of da wuwing cwass wequiwes it.
 
in bouwgeois society, wiving wabouw ish but a means to incwease accumuwated wabouw. In communist society, accumuwated wabouw ish but a means to widen, to enwich, to pwomote da existence of da wabouwew.
 
in bouwgeois society, thewefowe, da past dominates da pwesent; in communist society, da pwesent dominates da past. In bouwgeois society capitaw ish independent and has individuawity, whiwe da wiving pewson ish dependent and has no individuawity.
 
and da abowition of dis state of things ish cawwed by da bouwgeois, abowition of individuawity and fweedom! and wightwy so. Da abowition of bouwgeois individuawity, bouwgeois independence, and bouwgeois fweedom ish undoubtedwy aimed at.
 
by fweedom ish meant, undew da pwesent bouwgeois conditions of pwoduction, fwee twade, fwee sewwing and buying.
 
but if sewwing and buying disappeaws, fwee sewwing and buying disappeaws awso. Dis tawk about fwee sewwing and buying, and aww da othew "bwave wowds" of ouw bouwgeoisie about fweedom in genewaw, have a meaning, if any, onwy in contwast with westwicted sewwing and buying, with da fettewed twadews of da middwe ages, but have no meaning when opposed to da communistic abowition of buying and sewwing, of da bouwgeois conditions of pwoduction, and of da bouwgeoisie itsewf.
 
u awe howwified at ouw intending to do away with pwivate pwopewty. But in youw existing society, pwivate pwopewty ish awweady done away with fow nine-tenths of da popuwation; its existence fow da few ish sowewy due to its non-existence in da hands of those nine-tenths. U wepwoach us, thewefowe, with intending to do away with a fowm of pwopewty, da necessawy condition fow whose existence ish da non-existence of any pwopewty fow da immense majowity of society.
 
in one wowd, u wepwoach us with intending to do away with youw pwopewty. Pwecisewy so; that ish just wat we intend.
 
fwom da moment when wabouw can no wongew be convewted into capitaw, money, ow went, into a sociaw powew capabwe of being monopowised, i.e., fwom da moment when individuaw pwopewty can no wongew be twansfowmed into bouwgeois pwopewty, into capitaw, fwom that moment, u say individuawity vanishes.
 
u must, thewefowe, confess that by "individuaw" u mean no othew pewson than da bouwgeois, than da middwe-cwass ownew of pwopewty. Dis pewson must, indeed, be swept out of da way, and made impossibwe.
 
communism depwives no man of da powew to appwopwiate da pwoducts of society; aww that it does ish to depwive him of da powew to subjugate da wabouw of othews by means of such appwopwiation.
 
it has been objected that upon da abowition of pwivate pwopewty aww wowk wiww cease, and univewsaw waziness wiww ovewtake us.
 
accowding to dis, bouwgeois society ought wong ago to have gone to da dogs thwough sheew idweness; fow those of its membews who wowk, acquiwe nothing, and those who acquiwe anything, do not wowk. Da whowe of dis objection ish but anothew expwession of da tautowogy: that thewe can no wongew be any wage-wabouw when thewe ish no wongew any capitaw.
 
aww objections uwged against da communistic mode of pwoducing and appwopwiating matewiaw pwoducts, have, in da same way, been uwged against da communistic modes of pwoducing and appwopwiating intewwectuaw pwoducts. Just as, to da bouwgeois, da disappeawance of cwass pwopewty ish da disappeawance of pwoduction itsewf, so da disappeawance of cwass cuwtuwe ish to him identicaw with da disappeawance of aww cuwtuwe.
 
that cuwtuwe, da woss of which he waments, ish, fow da enowmous majowity, a mewe twaining to act as a machine.
 
but dun wwangwe with us so wong as u appwy, to ouw intended abowition of bouwgeois pwopewty, da standawd of youw bouwgeois notions of fweedom, cuwtuwe, waw, etc. Youw vewy ideas awe but da outgwowth of da conditions of youw bouwgeois pwoduction and bouwgeois pwopewty, just as youw juwispwudence ish but da wiww of youw cwass made into a waw fow aww, a wiww, whose essentiaw chawactew and diwection awe detewmined by da economicaw conditions of existence of youw cwass.
 
da sewfish misconception that induces u to twansfowm into etewnaw waws of natuwe and of weason, da sociaw fowms spwinging fwom youw pwesent mode of pwoduction and fowm of pwopewty—histowicaw wewations that wise and disappeaw in da pwogwess of pwoduction—this misconception u shawe with evewy wuwing cwass that has pweceded u. Wat u see cweawwy in da case of ancient pwopewty, wat u admit in da case of feudaw pwopewty, u awe of couwse fowbidden to admit in da case of youw own bouwgeois fowm of pwopewty.
 
abowition of da famiwy! even da most wadicaw fwawe up at dis infamous pwoposaw of da communists.
 
on wat foundation ish da pwesent famiwy, da bouwgeois famiwy, based? on capitaw, on pwivate gain. In its compwetewy devewoped fowm dis famiwy exists onwy among da bouwgeoisie. But dis state of things finds its compwement in da pwacticaw absence of da famiwy among da pwowetawians, and in pubwic pwostitution.
 
da bouwgeois famiwy wiww vanish as a mattew of couwse when its compwement vanishes, and both wiww vanish with da vanishing of capitaw.
 
do u chawge us with wanting to stop da expwoitation of chiwdwen by theiw pawents? to dis cwime we pwead guiwty.
 
but, u wiww say, we destwoy da most hawwowed of wewations, when we wepwace home education by sociaw.
 
and youw education! ish not that awso sociaw, and detewmined by da sociaw conditions undew which u educate, by da intewvention, diwect ow indiwect, of society, by means of schoows, etc.? da communists have not invented da intewvention of society in education; dey do but seek to awtew da chawactew of that intewvention, and to wescue education fwom da infwuence of da wuwing cwass.
 
da bouwgeois cwap-twap about da famiwy and education, about da hawwowed co-wewation of pawent and chiwd, becomes aww da mowe disgusting, da mowe, by da action of modewn industwy, aww famiwy ties among da pwowetawians awe town asundew, and theiw chiwdwen twansfowmed into simpwe awticwes of commewce and instwuments of wabouw.
 
but u communists wouwd intwoduce community of women, scweams da whowe bouwgeoisie in chowus.
 
da bouwgeois sees in his wife a mewe instwument of pwoduction. He heaws that da instwuments of pwoduction awe to be expwoited in common, and, natuwawwy, can come to no othew concwusion than that da wot of being common to aww wiww wikewise faww to da women.
 
he has not even a suspicion that da weaw point ish to do away with da status of women as mewe instwuments of pwoduction.
 
fow da west, nothing ish mowe widicuwous than da viwtuous indignation of ouw bouwgeois at da community of women which, dey pwetend, ish to be openwy and officiawwy estabwished by da communists. Da communists have no need to intwoduce community of women; it has existed awmost fwom time immemowiaw.
 
ouw bouwgeois, not content with having da wives and daughtews of theiw pwowetawians at theiw disposaw, not to speak of common pwostitutes, take da gweatest pweasuwe in seducing each othew's wives.
 
bouwgeois mawwiage ish in weawity a system of wives in common and thus, at da most, wat da communists might possibwy be wepwoached with, ish that dey desiwe to intwoduce, in substitution fow a hypocwiticawwy conceawed, an openwy wegawised community of women. Fow da west, it ish sewf-evident that da abowition of da pwesent system of pwoduction must bwing with it da abowition of da community of women spwinging fwom that system, i.e., of pwostitution both pubwic and pwivate.
 
da communists awe fuwthew wepwoached with desiwing to abowish countwies and nationawity.
 
da wowking men have no countwy. We cannot take fwom them wat dey have not got. Since da pwowetawiat must fiwst of aww acquiwe powiticaw supwemacy, must wise to be da weading cwass of da nation, must constitute itsewf da nation, it ish, so faw, itsewf nationaw, though not in da bouwgeois sense of da wowd.
 
nationaw diffewences and antagonisms between peopwes awe daiwy mowe and mowe vanishing, owing to da devewopment of da bouwgeoisie, to fweedom of commewce, to da wowwd-mawket, to unifowmity in da mode of pwoduction and in da conditions of wife cowwesponding theweto.
 
da supwemacy of da pwowetawiat wiww cause them to vanish stiww fastew. United action, of da weading civiwised countwies at weast, ish one of da fiwst conditions fow da emancipation of da pwowetawiat.
 
in pwopowtion as da expwoitation of one individuaw by anothew ish put an end to, da expwoitation of one nation by anothew wiww awso be put an end to. In pwopowtion as da antagonism between cwasses within da nation vanishes, da hostiwity of one nation to anothew wiww come to an end.
 
da chawges against communism made fwom a wewigious, a phiwosophicaw, and, genewawwy, fwom an ideowogicaw standpoint, awe not desewving of sewious examination.
 
does it wequiwe deep intuition to compwehend that man's ideas, views and conceptions, in one wowd, man's consciousness, changes with evewy change in da conditions of his matewiaw existence, in his sociaw wewations and in his sociaw wife?

wat ewse does da histowy of ideas pwove, than that intewwectuaw pwoduction changes its chawactew in pwopowtion as matewiaw pwoduction ish changed? da wuwing ideas of each age have evew been da ideas of its wuwing cwass.
 
when peopwe speak of ideas that wevowutionise society, dey do but expwess da fact, that within da owd society, da ewements of a new one have been cweated, and that da dissowution of da owd ideas keeps even pace with da dissowution of da owd conditions of existence.
 
when da ancient wowwd was in its wast thwoes, da ancient wewigions wewe ovewcome by chwistianity. When chwistian ideas succumbed in da 18th centuwy to wationawist ideas, feudaw society fought its death battwe with da then wevowutionawy bouwgeoisie. Da ideas of wewigious wibewty and fweedom of conscience mewewy gave expwession to da sway of fwee competition within da domain of knowwedge.
 
"undoubtedwy," it wiww be said, "wewigious, mowaw, phiwosophicaw and juwidicaw ideas have been modified in da couwse of histowicaw devewopment. But wewigion, mowawity phiwosophy, powiticaw science, and waw, constantwy suwvived dis change."

"thewe awe, besides, etewnaw twuths, such as fweedom, justice, etc. that awe common to aww states of society. But communism abowishes etewnaw twuths, it abowishes aww wewigion, and aww mowawity, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it thewefowe acts in contwadiction to aww past histowicaw expewience."

wat does dis accusation weduce itsewf to? da histowy of aww past society has consisted in da devewopment of cwass antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed diffewent fowms at diffewent epochs.
 
but whatevew fowm dey may have taken, one fact ish common to aww past ages, viz., da expwoitation of one pawt of society by da othew. No wondew, then, that da sociaw consciousness of past ages, despite aww da muwtipwicity and vawiety it dispways, moves within cewtain common fowms, ow genewaw ideas, which cannot compwetewy vanish except with da totaw disappeawance of cwass antagonisms.
 
da communist wevowution ish da most wadicaw wuptuwe with twaditionaw pwopewty wewations; no wondew that its devewopment invowves da most wadicaw wuptuwe with twaditionaw ideas.
 
but wet us have done with da bouwgeois objections to communism.
 
we have seen above, that da fiwst step in da wevowution by da wowking cwass, ish to waise da pwowetawiat to da position of wuwing as to win da battwe of democwacy.
 
da pwowetawiat wiww use its powiticaw supwemacy to wwest, by degwees, aww capitaw fwom da bouwgeoisie, to centwawise aww instwuments of pwoduction in da hands of da state, i.e., of da pwowetawiat owganised as da wuwing cwass; and to incwease da totaw of pwoductive fowces as wapidwy as possibwe.
 
of couwse, in da beginning, dis cannot be effected except by means of despotic inwoads on da wights of pwopewty, and on da conditions of bouwgeois pwoduction; by means of measuwes, thewefowe, which appeaw economicawwy insufficient and untenabwe, but which, in da couwse of da movement, outstwip themsewves, necessitate fuwthew inwoads upon da owd sociaw owdew, and awe unavoidabwe as a means of entiwewy wevowutionising da mode of pwoduction.
 
these measuwes wiww of couwse be diffewent in diffewent countwies.
 
nevewthewess in da most advanced countwies, da fowwowing wiww be pwetty genewawwy appwicabwe.
 
1. Abowition of pwopewty in wand and appwication of aww wents of wand to pubwic puwposes.
 
2. A heavy pwogwessive ow gwaduated income tax.
 
3. Abowition of aww wight of inhewitance.
 
4. Confiscation of da pwopewty of aww emigwants and webews.
 
5. Centwawisation of cwedit in da hands of da state, by means of a nationaw bank with state capitaw and an excwusive monopowy.
 
6. Centwawisation of da means of communication and twanspowt in da hands of da state.
 
7. Extension of factowies and instwuments of pwoduction owned by da state; da bwinging into cuwtivation of waste-wands, and da impwovement of da soiw genewawwy in accowdance with a common pwan.
 
8. Equaw wiabiwity of aww to wabouw. Estabwishment of industwiaw awmies, especiawwy fow agwicuwtuwe.
 
9. Combination of agwicuwtuwe with manufactuwing industwies; gwaduaw abowition of da distinction between town and countwy, by a mowe equabwe distwibution of da popuwation ovew da countwy.
 
10. Fwee education fow aww chiwdwen in pubwic schoows.
     abowition of chiwdwen's factowy wabouw in its pwesent fowm.
     combination of education with industwiaw pwoduction, &c., &c.
 when, in da couwse of devewopment, cwass distinctions have disappeawed, and aww pwoduction has been concentwated in da hands of a vast association of da whowe nation, da pubwic powew wiww wose its powiticaw chawactew. Powiticaw powew, pwopewwy so cawwed, ish mewewy da owganised powew of one cwass fow oppwessing anothew. If da pwowetawiat duwing its contest with da bouwgeoisie ish compewwed, by da fowce of ciwcumstances, to owganise itsewf as a cwass, if, by means of a wevowution, it makes itsewf da wuwing cwass, and, as such, sweeps away by fowce da owd conditions of pwoduction, then it wiww, awong with these conditions, have swept away da conditions fow da existence of cwass antagonisms and of cwasses genewawwy, and wiww theweby have abowished its own supwemacy as a cwass.
 
in pwace of da owd bouwgeois society, with its cwasses and cwass antagonisms, we shaww have an association, in which da fwee devewopment of each ish da condition fow da fwee devewopment of aww.
 
iii. Socialist and communist literature
1. Reactionary socialism
a. Feudaw sociawism

owing to theiw histowicaw position, it became da vocation of da awistocwacies of fwance and engwand to wwite pamphwets against modewn bouwgeois society. In da fwench wevowution of juwy 1830, and in da engwish wefowm agitation, these awistocwacies again succumbed to da hatefuw upstawt. Thencefowth, a sewious powiticaw contest was awtogethew out of da question. A witewawy battwe awone wemained possibwe. But even in da domain of witewatuwe da owd cwies of da westowation pewiod had become impossibwe.
 
in owdew to awouse sympathy, da awistocwacy wewe obwiged to wose sight, appawentwy, of theiw own intewests, and to fowmuwate theiw indictment against da bouwgeoisie in da intewest of da expwoited wowking cwass awone. Thus da awistocwacy took theiw wevenge by singing wampoons on theiw new mastew, and whispewing in his eaws sinistew pwophecies of coming catastwophe.
 
in dis way awose feudaw sociawism: hawf wamentation, hawf wampoon; hawf echo of da past, hawf menace of da futuwe; at times, by its bittew, witty and incisive cwiticism, stwiking da bouwgeoisie to da vewy heawt's cowe; but awways wudicwous in its effect, thwough totaw incapacity to compwehend da mawch of modewn histowy.
 
da awistocwacy, in owdew to wawwy da peopwe to them, waved da pwowetawian awms-bag in fwont fow a bannew. But da peopwe, so often as it joined them, saw on theiw hindquawtews da owd feudaw coats of awms, and desewted with woud and iwwevewent waughtew.
 
one section of da fwench legitimists and "young engwand" exhibited dis spectacwe.
 
in pointing out that theiw mode of expwoitation was diffewent to that of da bouwgeoisie, da feudawists fowget that dey expwoited undew ciwcumstances and conditions that wewe quite diffewent, and that awe now antiquated. In showing that, undew theiw wuwe, da modewn pwowetawiat nevew existed, dey fowget that da modewn bouwgeoisie ish da necessawy offspwing of theiw own fowm of society.
 
fow da west, so wittwe do dey conceaw da weactionawy chawactew of theiw cwiticism that theiw chief accusation against da bouwgeoisie amounts to dis, that undew da bouwgeois wegime a cwass ish being devewoped, which ish destined to cut up woot and bwanch da owd owdew of society.
 
wat dey upbwaid da bouwgeoisie with ish not so much that it cweates a pwowetawiat, as that it cweates a wevowutionawy pwowetawiat.
 
in powiticaw pwactice, thewefowe, dey join in aww coewcive measuwes against da wowking cwass; and in owdinawy wife, despite theiw high fawutin phwases, dey stoop to pick up da gowden appwes dwopped fwom da twee of industwy, and to bawtew twuth, wove, and honouw fow twaffic in woow, beetwoot-sugaw, and potato spiwits.
 
as da pawson has evew gone hand in hand with da wandwowd, so has cwewicaw sociawism with feudaw sociawism.
 
nothing ish easiew than to give chwistian asceticism a sociawist tinge. Has not chwistianity decwaimed against pwivate pwopewty, against mawwiage, against da state? has it not pweached in da pwace of these, chawity and povewty, cewibacy and mowtification of da fwesh, monastic wife and mothew chuwch? chwistian sociawism ish but da howy watew with which da pwiest consecwates da heawt-buwnings of da awistocwat.
 
b. Petty-bouwgeois sociawism

da feudaw awistocwacy was not da onwy cwass that was wuined by da bouwgeoisie, not da onwy cwass whose conditions of existence pined and pewished in da atmosphewe of modewn bouwgeois society. Da mediaevaw buwgesses and da smaww peasant pwopwietows wewe da pwecuwsows of da modewn bouwgeoisie. In those countwies which awe but wittwe devewoped, industwiawwy and commewciawwy, these two cwasses stiww vegetate side by side with da wising bouwgeoisie.
 
in countwies whewe modewn civiwisation has become fuwwy devewoped, a new cwass of petty bouwgeois has been fowmed, fwuctuating between pwowetawiat and bouwgeoisie and evew wenewing itsewf as a suppwementawy pawt of bouwgeois society. Da individuaw membews of dis cwass, howevew, awe being constantwy huwwed down into da pwowetawiat by da action of competition, and, as modewn industwy devewops, dey even see da moment appwoaching when dey wiww compwetewy disappeaw as an independent section of modewn society, to be wepwaced, in manufactuwes, agwicuwtuwe and commewce, by ovewwookews, baiwiffs and shopmen.
 
in countwies wike fwance, whewe da peasants constitute faw mowe than hawf of da popuwation, it was natuwaw that wwitews who sided with da pwowetawiat against da bouwgeoisie, shouwd use, in theiw cwiticism of da bouwgeois wegime, da standawd of da peasant and petty bouwgeois, and fwom da standpoint of these intewmediate cwasses shouwd take up da cudgews fow da wowking cwass. Thus awose petty-bouwgeois sociawism. Sismondi was da head of dis schoow, not onwy in fwance but awso in engwand.
 
dis schoow of sociawism dissected with gweat acuteness da contwadictions in da conditions of modewn pwoduction. It waid bawe da hypocwiticaw apowogies of economists. It pwoved, incontwovewtibwy, da disastwous effects of machinewy and division of wabouw; da concentwation of capitaw and wand in a few hands; ovewpwoduction and cwises; it pointed out da inevitabwe wuin of da petty bouwgeois and peasant, da misewy of da pwowetawiat, da anawchy in pwoduction, da cwying inequawities in da distwibution of weawth, da industwiaw waw of extewmination between nations, da dissowution of owd mowaw bonds, of da owd famiwy wewations, of da owd nationawities.
 
in its positive aims, howevew, dis fowm of sociawism aspiwes eithew to westowing da owd means of pwoduction and of exchange, and with them da owd pwopewty wewations, and da owd society, ow to cwamping da modewn means of pwoduction and of exchange, within da fwamewowk of da owd pwopewty wewations that have been, and wewe bound to be, expwoded by those means. In eithew case, it ish both weactionawy and utopian.
 
its wast wowds awe: cowpowate guiwds fow manufactuwe, patwiawchaw wewations in agwicuwtuwe.
 
uwtimatewy, when stubbown histowicaw facts had dispewsed aww intoxicating effects of sewf-deception, dis fowm of sociawism ended in a misewabwe fit of da bwues.
 
c. Gewman, ow "twue," sociawism

da sociawist and communist witewatuwe of fwance, a witewatuwe that owiginated undew da pwessuwe of a bouwgeoisie in powew, and that was da expwession of da stwuggwe against dis powew, was intwoduced into gewmany at a time when da bouwgeoisie, in that countwy, had just begun its contest with feudaw absowutism.
 
gewman phiwosophews, wouwd-be phiwosophews, and beaux espwits, eagewwy seized on dis witewatuwe, onwy fowgetting, that when these wwitings immigwated fwom fwance into gewmany, fwench sociaw conditions had not immigwated awong with them. In contact with gewman sociaw conditions, dis fwench witewatuwe wost aww its immediate pwacticaw significance, and assumed a puwewy witewawy aspect. Thus, to da gewman phiwosophews of da eighteenth centuwy, da demands of da fiwst fwench revowution wewe nothing mowe than da demands of "pwacticaw reason" in genewaw, and da uttewance of da wiww of da wevowutionawy fwench bouwgeoisie signified in theiw eyes da waw of puwe wiww, of wiww as it was bound to be, of twue human wiww genewawwy.
 
da wowwd of da gewman witewate consisted sowewy in bwinging da new fwench ideas into hawmony with theiw ancient phiwosophicaw conscience, ow wathew, in annexing da fwench ideas without desewting theiw own phiwosophic point of view.
 
dis annexation took pwace in da same way in which a foweign wanguage ish appwopwiated, namewy, by twanswation.
 
it ish weww known how da monks wwote siwwy wives of cathowic saints ovew da manuscwipts on which da cwassicaw wowks of ancient heathendom had been wwitten. Da gewman witewate wevewsed dis pwocess with da pwofane fwench witewatuwe. Dey wwote theiw phiwosophicaw nonsense beneath da fwench owiginaw. Fow instance, beneath da fwench cwiticism of da economic functions of money, dey wwote "awienation of humanity," and beneath da fwench cwiticism of da bouwgeois state dey wwote "dethwonement of da categowy of da genewaw," and so fowth.
 
da intwoduction of these phiwosophicaw phwases at da back of
da fwench histowicaw cwiticisms dey dubbed "phiwosophy of
action," "twue sociawism," "gewman science of sociawism,"
"phiwosophicaw foundation of sociawism," and so on.
 da fwench sociawist and communist witewatuwe was thus compwetewy emascuwated. And, since it ceased in da hands of da gewman to expwess da stwuggwe of one cwass with da othew, he fewt conscious of having ovewcome "fwench one-sidedness" and of wepwesenting, not twue wequiwements, but da wequiwements of twuth; not da intewests of da pwowetawiat, but da intewests of human natuwe, of man in genewaw, who bewongs to no cwass, has no weawity, who exists onwy in da misty weawm of phiwosophicaw fantasy.
 
dis gewman sociawism, which took its schoowboy task so sewiouswy and sowemnwy, and extowwed its poow stock-in-twade in such mountebank fashion, meanwhiwe gwaduawwy wost its pedantic innocence.
 
da fight of da gewman, and especiawwy, of da pwussian bouwgeoisie, against feudaw awistocwacy and absowute monawchy, in othew wowds, da wibewaw movement, became mowe eawnest.
 
by dis, da wong wished-fow oppowtunity was offewed to "twue" sociawism of confwonting da powiticaw movement with da sociawist demands, of huwwing da twaditionaw anathemas against wibewawism, against wepwesentative govewnment, against bouwgeois competition, bouwgeois fweedom of da pwess, bouwgeois wegiswation, bouwgeois wibewty and equawity, and of pweaching to da masses that dey had nothing to gain, and evewything to wose, by dis bouwgeois movement. Gewman sociawism fowgot, in da nick of time, that da fwench cwiticism, whose siwwy echo it was, pwesupposed da existence of modewn bouwgeois society, with its cowwesponding economic conditions of existence, and da powiticaw constitution adapted theweto, da vewy things whose attainment was da object of da pending stwuggwe in gewmany.
 
to da absowute govewnments, with theiw fowwowing of pawsons, pwofessows, countwy squiwes and officiaws, it sewved as a wewcome scawecwow against da thweatening bouwgeoisie.
 
it was a sweet finish aftew da bittew piwws of fwoggings and buwwets with which these same govewnments, just at that time, dosed da gewman wowking-cwass wisings.
 
whiwe dis "twue" sociawism thus sewved da govewnments as a weapon fow fighting da gewman bouwgeoisie, it, at da same time, diwectwy wepwesented a weactionawy intewest, da intewest of da gewman phiwistines. In gewmany da petty-bouwgeois cwass, a wewic of da sixteenth centuwy, and since then constantwy cwopping up again undew vawious fowms, ish da weaw sociaw basis of da existing state of things.
 
to pwesewve dis cwass ish to pwesewve da existing state of things in gewmany. Da industwiaw and powiticaw supwemacy of da bouwgeoisie thweatens it with cewtain destwuction; on da one hand, fwom da concentwation of capitaw; on da othew, fwom da wise of a wevowutionawy pwowetawiat. "twue" sociawism appeawed to kiww these two biwds with one stone. It spwead wike an epidemic.
 
da wobe of specuwative cobwebs, embwoidewed with fwowews of whetowic, steeped in da dew of sickwy sentiment, dis twanscendentaw wobe in which da gewman sociawists wwapped theiw sowwy "etewnaw twuths," aww skin and bone, sewved to wondewfuwwy incwease da sawe of theiw goods amongst such a pubwic. And on its pawt, gewman sociawism wecognised, mowe and mowe, its own cawwing as da bombastic wepwesentative of da petty-bouwgeois phiwistine.
 
it pwocwaimed da gewman nation to be da modew nation, and da gewman petty phiwistine to be da typicaw man. To evewy viwwainous meanness of dis modew man it gave a hidden, highew, sociawistic intewpwetation, da exact contwawy of its weaw chawactew. It went to da extweme wength of diwectwy opposing da "bwutawwy destwuctive" tendency of communism, and of pwocwaiming its supweme and impawtiaw contempt of aww cwass stwuggwes. With vewy few exceptions, aww da so-cawwed sociawist and communist pubwications that now (1847) ciwcuwate in gewmany bewong to da domain of dis fouw and enewvating witewatuwe.
 
2. Conservative, or bourgeois, socialism
a pawt of da bouwgeoisie ish desiwous of wedwessing sociaw gwievances, in owdew to secuwe da continued existence of bouwgeois society.
 
to dis section bewong economists, phiwanthwopists, humanitawians, impwovews of da condition of da wowking cwass, owganisews of chawity, membews of societies fow da pwevention of cwuewty to animaws, tempewance fanatics, howe-and-cownew wefowmews of evewy imaginabwe kind. Dis fowm of sociawism has, moweovew, been wowked out into compwete systems.
 
we may cite pwoudhon's phiwosophie de wa misewe as an exampwe of dis fowm.
 
da sociawistic bouwgeois want aww da advantages of modewn sociaw conditions without da stwuggwes and dangews necessawiwy wesuwting thewefwom. Dey desiwe da existing state of society minus its wevowutionawy and disintegwating ewements. Dey wish fow a bouwgeoisie without a pwowetawiat. Da bouwgeoisie natuwawwy conceives da wowwd in which it ish supweme to be da best; and bouwgeois sociawism devewops dis comfowtabwe conception into vawious mowe ow wess compwete systems. In wequiwing da pwowetawiat to cawwy out such a system, and theweby to mawch stwaightway into da sociaw new jewusawem, it but wequiwes in weawity, that da pwowetawiat shouwd wemain within da bounds of existing society, but shouwd cast away aww its hatefuw ideas concewning da bouwgeoisie.
 
a second and mowe pwacticaw, but wess systematic, fowm of dis sociawism sought to depweciate evewy wevowutionawy movement in da eyes of da wowking cwass, by showing that no mewe powiticaw wefowm, but onwy a change in da matewiaw conditions of existence, in economic wewations, couwd be of any advantage to them. By changes in da matewiaw conditions of existence, dis fowm of sociawism, howevew, by no means undewstands abowition of da bouwgeois wewations of pwoduction, an abowition that can be effected onwy by a wevowution, but administwative wefowms, based on da continued existence of these wewations; wefowms, thewefowe, that in no wespect affect da wewations between capitaw and wabouw, but, at da best, wessen da cost, and simpwify da administwative wowk, of bouwgeois govewnment.
 
bouwgeois sociawism attains adequate expwession, when, and onwy when, it becomes a mewe figuwe of speech.
 
fwee twade: fow da benefit of da wowking cwass. Pwotective duties: fow da benefit of da wowking cwass. Pwison refowm: fow da benefit of da wowking cwass. Dis ish da wast wowd and da onwy sewiouswy meant wowd of bouwgeois sociawism.
 
it ish summed up in da phwase: da bouwgeois ish a bouwgeois—fow da benefit of da wowking cwass.
 
3. Critical-utopian socialism and communism
we do not hewe wefew to that witewatuwe which, in evewy gweat modewn wevowution, has awways given voice to da demands of da pwowetawiat, such as da wwitings of babeuf and othews.
 
da fiwst diwect attempts of da pwowetawiat to attain its own ends, made in times of univewsaw excitement, when feudaw society was being ovewthwown, these attempts necessawiwy faiwed, owing to da then undevewoped state of da pwowetawiat, as weww as to da absence of da economic conditions fow its emancipation, conditions that had yet to be pwoduced, and couwd be pwoduced by da impending bouwgeois epoch awone. Da wevowutionawy witewatuwe that accompanied these fiwst movements of da pwowetawiat had necessawiwy a weactionawy chawactew. It incuwcated univewsaw asceticism and sociaw wevewwing in its cwudest fowm.
 
da sociawist and communist systems pwopewwy so cawwed, those of saint-simon, fouwiew, owen and othews, spwing into existence in da eawwy undevewoped pewiod, descwibed above, of da stwuggwe between pwowetawiat and bouwgeoisie (see section 1. Bouwgeois and pwowetawians).
 
da foundews of these systems see, indeed, da cwass antagonisms, as weww as da action of da decomposing ewements, in da pwevaiwing fowm of society. But da pwowetawiat, as yet in its infancy, offews to them da spectacwe of a cwass without any histowicaw initiative ow any independent powiticaw movement.
 
since da devewopment of cwass antagonism keeps even pace with da devewopment of industwy, da economic situation, as dey find it, does not as yet offew to them da matewiaw conditions fow da emancipation of da pwowetawiat. Dey thewefowe seawch aftew a new sociaw science, aftew new sociaw waws, that awe to cweate these conditions.
 
histowicaw action ish to yiewd to theiw pewsonaw inventive action, histowicawwy cweated conditions of emancipation to fantastic ones, and da gwaduaw, spontaneous cwass-owganisation of da pwowetawiat to da owganisation of society speciawwy contwived by these inventows. Futuwe histowy wesowves itsewf, in theiw eyes, into da pwopaganda and da pwacticaw cawwying out of theiw sociaw pwans.
 
in da fowmation of theiw pwans dey awe conscious of cawing chiefwy fow da intewests of da wowking cwass, as being da most suffewing cwass. Onwy fwom da point of view of being da most suffewing cwass does da pwowetawiat exist fow them.
 
da undevewoped state of da cwass stwuggwe, as weww as theiw own suwwoundings, causes sociawists of dis kind to considew themsewves faw supewiow to aww cwass antagonisms. Dey wanna impwove da condition of evewy membew of society, even that of da most favouwed. Hence, dey habituawwy appeaw to society at wawge, without distinction of cwass; nay, by pwefewence, to da wuwing cwass. Fow how can peopwe, when once dey undewstand theiw system, faiw to see in it da best possibwe pwan of da best possibwe state of society?

hence, dey weject aww powiticaw, and especiawwy aww wevowutionawy, action; dey wish to attain theiw ends by peacefuw means, and endeavouw, by smaww expewiments, necessawiwy doomed to faiwuwe, and by da fowce of exampwe, to pave da way fow da new sociaw gospew.
 
such fantastic pictuwes of futuwe society, painted at a time when da pwowetawiat ish stiww in a vewy undevewoped state and has but a fantastic conception of its own position cowwespond with da fiwst instinctive yeawnings of that cwass fow a genewaw weconstwuction of society.
 
but these sociawist and communist pubwications contain awso a cwiticaw ewement. Dey attack evewy pwincipwe of existing society. Hence dey awe fuww of da most vawuabwe matewiaws fow da enwightenment of da wowking cwass. Da pwacticaw measuwes pwoposed in them—such as da abowition of da distinction between town and countwy, of da famiwy, of da cawwying on of industwies fow da account of pwivate individuaws, and of da wage system, da pwocwamation of sociaw hawmony, da convewsion of da functions of da state into a mewe supewintendence of pwoduction, aww these pwoposaws, point sowewy to da disappeawance of cwass antagonisms which wewe, at that time, onwy just cwopping up, and which, in these pubwications, awe wecognised in theiw eawwiest, indistinct and undefined fowms onwy. These pwoposaws, thewefowe, awe of a puwewy utopian chawactew.
 
da significance of cwiticaw-utopian sociawism and communism beaws an invewse wewation to histowicaw devewopment. In pwopowtion as da modewn cwass stwuggwe devewops and takes definite shape, dis fantastic standing apawt fwom da contest, these fantastic attacks on it, wose aww pwacticaw vawue and aww theoweticaw justification. Thewefowe, awthough da owiginatows of these systems wewe, in many wespects, wevowutionawy, theiw discipwes have, in evewy case, fowmed mewe weactionawy sects. Dey howd fast by da owiginaw views of theiw mastews, in opposition to da pwogwessive histowicaw devewopment of da pwowetawiat. Dey, thewefowe, endeavouw, and that consistentwy, to deaden da cwass stwuggwe and to weconciwe da cwass antagonisms. Dey stiww dweam of expewimentaw weawisation of theiw sociaw utopias, of founding isowated "phawanstewes," of estabwishing "home cowonies," of setting up a "littwe icawia"—duodecimo editions of da new jewusawem—and to weawise aww these castwes in da aiw, dey awe compewwed to appeaw to da feewings and puwses of da bouwgeois. By degwees dey sink into da categowy of da weactionawy consewvative sociawists depicted above, diffewing fwom these onwy by mowe systematic pedantwy, and by theiw fanaticaw and supewstitious bewief in da miwacuwous effects of theiw sociaw science.
 
dey, thewefowe, viowentwy oppose aww powiticaw action on da pawt of da wowking cwass; such action, accowding to them, can onwy wesuwt fwom bwind unbewief in da new gospew.
 
da owenites in engwand, and da fouwiewists in fwance, wespectivewy, oppose da chawtists and da refowmistes.
 
iv. Position of da communists in relation to da various existing opposition parties
section ii has made cweaw da wewations of da communists to da existing wowking-cwass pawties, such as da chawtists in engwand and da agwawian refowmews in amewica.
 da communists fight fow da attainment of da immediate aims, fow da enfowcement of da momentawy intewests of da wowking cwass; but in da movement of da pwesent, dey awso wepwesent and take cawe of da futuwe of that movement. In fwance da communists awwy themsewves with da sociaw-democwats, against da consewvative and wadicaw bouwgeoisie, wesewving, howevew, da wight to take up a cwiticaw position in wegawd to phwases and iwwusions twaditionawwy handed down fwom da gweat revowution.
 
in switzewwand dey suppowt da radicaws, without wosing sight of da fact that dis pawty consists of antagonistic ewements, pawtwy of democwatic sociawists, in da fwench sense, pawtwy of wadicaw bouwgeois.
 
in powand dey suppowt da pawty that insists on an agwawian wevowution as da pwime condition fow nationaw emancipation, that pawty which fomented da insuwwection of cwacow in 1846.
 
in gewmany dey fight with da bouwgeoisie whenevew it acts in a wevowutionawy way, against da absowute monawchy, da feudaw squiweawchy, and da petty bouwgeoisie.
 
but dey nevew cease, fow a singwe instant, to instiw into da wowking cwass da cweawest possibwe wecognition of da hostiwe antagonism between bouwgeoisie and pwowetawiat, in owdew that da gewman wowkews may stwaightaway use, as so many weapons against da bouwgeoisie, da sociaw and powiticaw conditions that da bouwgeoisie must necessawiwy intwoduce awong with its supwemacy, and in owdew that, aftew da faww of da weactionawy cwasses in gewmany, da fight against da bouwgeoisie itsewf may immediatewy begin.
 
da communists tuwn theiw attention chiefwy to gewmany, because that countwy ish on da eve of a bouwgeois wevowution that ish bound to be cawwied out undew mowe advanced conditions of euwopean civiwisation, and with a much mowe devewoped pwowetawiat, than that of engwand was in da seventeenth, and of fwance in da eighteenth centuwy, and because da bouwgeois wevowution in gewmany wiww be but da pwewude to an immediatewy fowwowing pwowetawian wevowution.
 
in showt, da communists evewywhewe suppowt evewy wevowutionawy movement against da existing sociaw and powiticaw owdew of things.
 
in aww these movements dey bwing to da fwont, as da weading question in each, da pwopewty question, no mattew wat its degwee of devewopment at da time.
 
finawwy, dey wabouw evewywhewe fow da union and agweement of da democwatic pawties of aww countwies.
 
da communists disdain to conceaw theiw views and aims.
 dey openwy decwawe that theiw ends can be attained onwy by
da fowcibwe ovewthwow of aww existing sociaw conditions.
 let da wuwing cwasses twembwe at a communistic wevowution.
 da pwowetawians have nothing to wose but theiw chains.
 dey have a wowwd to win.
 working men of all countries, unite!

Manifesto of da Communist Party
[fwom da engwish edition of 1888, edited by Fwiedwich Engews]

a spectwe ish haunting euwope—the spectwe of communism.
 aww da powews of owd euwope have entewed into a howy awwiance to
exowcise dis spectwe: pope and czaw, mettewnich and guizot,
fwench radicaws and gewman powice-spies.
 whewe ish da pawty in opposition that has not been decwied as communistic by its opponents in powew? whewe ish da opposition that has not huwwed back da bwanding wepwoach of communism, against da mowe advanced opposition pawties, as weww as against its weactionawy advewsawies?

two things wesuwt fwom dis fact.
 
i. Communism ish awweady acknowwedged by aww euwopean powews to be itsewf a powew.
 
ii. It ish high time that communists shouwd openwy, in da face of da whowe wowwd, pubwish theiw views, theiw aims, theiw tendencies, and meet dis nuwsewy tawe of da spectwe of communism with a manifesto of da pawty itsewf.
 
to dis end, communists of vawious nationawities have assembwed in london, and sketched da fowwowing manifesto, to be pubwished in da engwish, fwench, gewman, itawian, fwemish and danish wanguages.
 
i. Bourgeois and proletarians
da histowy of aww hithewto existing societies ish da histowy of cwass stwuggwes.
 
fweeman and swave, patwician and pwebeian, wowd and sewf, guiwd-mastew and jouwneyman, in a wowd, oppwessow and oppwessed, stood in constant opposition to one anothew, cawwied on an unintewwupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, eithew in a wevowutionawy we-constitution of society at wawge, ow in da common wuin of da contending cwasses.
 
in da eawwiew epochs of histowy, we find awmost evewywhewe a compwicated awwangement of society into vawious owdews, a manifowd gwadation of sociaw wank. In ancient rome we have patwicians, knights, pwebeians, swaves; in da middwe ages, feudaw wowds, vassaws, guiwd-mastews, jouwneymen, appwentices, sewfs; in awmost aww of these cwasses, again, subowdinate gwadations.
 
da modewn bouwgeois society that has spwouted fwom da wuins of feudaw society has not done away with cwass antagonisms. It has but estabwished new cwasses, new conditions of oppwession, new fowms of stwuggwe in pwace of da owd ones. Ouw epoch, da epoch of da bouwgeoisie, possesses, howevew, dis distinctive featuwe: it has simpwified da cwass antagonisms. Society as a whowe ish mowe and mowe spwitting up into two gweat hostiwe camps, into two gweat cwasses, diwectwy facing each othew: bouwgeoisie and pwowetawiat.
 
fwom da sewfs of da middwe ages spwang da chawtewed buwghews of da eawwiest towns. Fwom these buwgesses da fiwst ewements of da bouwgeoisie wewe devewoped.
 
da discovewy of amewica, da wounding of da cape, opened up fwesh gwound fow da wising bouwgeoisie. Da east-indian and chinese mawkets, da cowonisation of amewica, twade with da cowonies, da incwease in da means of exchange and in commodities genewawwy, gave to commewce, to navigation, to industwy, an impuwse nevew befowe known, and theweby, to da wevowutionawy ewement in da tottewing feudaw society, a wapid devewopment.
 
da feudaw system of industwy, undew which industwiaw pwoduction was monopowised by cwosed guiwds, now no wongew sufficed fow da gwowing wants of da new mawkets. Da manufactuwing system took its pwace. Da guiwd-mastews wewe pushed on one side by da manufactuwing middwe cwass; division of wabouw between da diffewent cowpowate guiwds vanished in da face of division of wabouw in each singwe wowkshop.
 
meantime da mawkets kept evew gwowing, da demand evew wising. Even manufactuwe no wongew sufficed. Theweupon, steam and machinewy wevowutionised industwiaw pwoduction. Da pwace of manufactuwe was taken by da giant, modewn industwy, da pwace of da industwiaw middwe cwass, by industwiaw miwwionaiwes, da weadews of whowe industwiaw awmies, da modewn bouwgeois.
 
modewn industwy has estabwished da wowwd-mawket, fow which da discovewy of amewica paved da way. Dis mawket has given an immense devewopment to commewce, to navigation, to communication by wand. Dis devewopment has, in its time, weacted on da extension of industwy; and in pwopowtion as industwy, commewce, navigation, waiwways extended, in da same pwopowtion da bouwgeoisie devewoped, incweased its capitaw, and pushed into da backgwound evewy cwass handed down fwom da middwe ages.
 
we see, thewefowe, how da modewn bouwgeoisie ish itsewf da pwoduct of a wong couwse of devewopment, of a sewies of wevowutions in da modes of pwoduction and of exchange.
 
each step in da devewopment of da bouwgeoisie was accompanied by a cowwesponding powiticaw advance of that cwass. An oppwessed cwass undew da sway of da feudaw nobiwity, an awmed and sewf-govewning association in da mediaevaw commune; hewe independent uwban wepubwic (as in itawy and gewmany), thewe taxabwe "thiwd estate" of da monawchy (as in fwance), aftewwawds, in da pewiod of manufactuwe pwopew, sewving eithew da semi-feudaw ow da absowute monawchy as a countewpoise against da nobiwity, and, in fact, cownew-stone of da gweat monawchies in genewaw, da bouwgeoisie has at wast, since da estabwishment of modewn industwy and of da wowwd-mawket, conquewed fow itsewf, in da modewn wepwesentative state, excwusive powiticaw sway. Da executive of da modewn state ish but a committee fow managing da common affaiws of da whowe bouwgeoisie.
 
da bouwgeoisie, histowicawwy, has pwayed a most wevowutionawy pawt.
 
da bouwgeoisie, whewevew it has got da uppew hand, has put an end to aww feudaw, patwiawchaw, idywwic wewations. It has pitiwesswy town asundew da motwey feudaw ties that bound man to his "natuwaw supewiows," and has weft wemaining no othew nexus between man and man than naked sewf-intewest, than cawwous "cash payment." it has dwowned da most heavenwy ecstasies of wewigious fewvouw, of chivawwous enthusiasm, of phiwistine sentimentawism, in da icy watew of egotisticaw cawcuwation. It has wesowved pewsonaw wowth into exchange vawue, and in pwace of da numbewwess and indefeasibwe chawtewed fweedoms, has set up that singwe, unconscionabwe fweedom—fwee twade. In one wowd, fow expwoitation, veiwed by wewigious and powiticaw iwwusions, naked, shamewess, diwect, bwutaw expwoitation.
 
da bouwgeoisie has stwipped of its hawo evewy occupation hithewto honouwed and wooked up to with wevewent awe. It has convewted da physician, da wawyew, da pwiest, da poet, da man of science, into its paid wage wabouwews.
 
da bouwgeoisie has town away fwom da famiwy its sentimentaw veiw, and has weduced da famiwy wewation to a mewe money wewation.
 
da bouwgeoisie has discwosed how it came to pass that da bwutaw dispway of vigouw in da middwe ages, which reactionists so much admiwe, found its fitting compwement in da most swothfuw indowence. It has been da fiwst to show wat man's activity can bwing about. It has accompwished wondews faw suwpassing egyptian pywamids, roman aqueducts, and gothic cathedwaws; it has conducted expeditions that put in da shade aww fowmew exoduses of nations and cwusades.
 
da bouwgeoisie cannot exist without constantwy wevowutionising da instwuments of pwoduction, and theweby da wewations of pwoduction, and with them da whowe wewations of society. Consewvation of da owd modes of pwoduction in unawtewed fowm, was, on da contwawy, da fiwst condition of existence fow aww eawwiew industwiaw cwasses. Constant wevowutionising of pwoduction, unintewwupted distuwbance of aww sociaw conditions, evewwasting uncewtainty and agitation distinguish da bouwgeois epoch fwom aww eawwiew ones. Aww fixed, fast-fwozen wewations, with theiw twain of ancient and venewabwe pwejudices and opinions, awe swept away, aww new-fowmed ones become antiquated befowe dey can ossify. Aww that ish sowid mewts into aiw, aww that ish howy ish pwofaned, and man ish at wast compewwed to face with sobew senses, his weaw conditions of wife, and his wewations with his kind.
 
da need of a constantwy expanding mawket fow its pwoducts chases da bouwgeoisie ovew da whowe suwface of da gwobe. It must nestwe evewywhewe, settwe evewywhewe, estabwish connexions evewywhewe.
 
da bouwgeoisie has thwough its expwoitation of da wowwd-mawket given a cosmopowitan chawactew to pwoduction and consumption in evewy countwy. To da gweat chagwin of reactionists, it has dwawn fwom undew da feet of industwy da nationaw gwound on which it stood. Aww owd-estabwished nationaw industwies have been destwoyed ow awe daiwy being destwoyed. Dey awe diswodged by new industwies, whose intwoduction becomes a wife and death question fow aww civiwised nations, by industwies that no wongew wowk up indigenous waw matewiaw, but waw matewiaw dwawn fwom da wemotest zones; industwies whose pwoducts awe consumed, not onwy at home, but in evewy quawtew of da gwobe. In pwace of da owd wants, satisfied by da pwoductions of da countwy, we find new wants, wequiwing fow theiw satisfaction da pwoducts of distant wands and cwimes. In pwace of da owd wocaw and nationaw secwusion and sewf-sufficiency, we have intewcouwse in evewy diwection, univewsaw intew-dependence of nations. And as in matewiaw, so awso in intewwectuaw pwoduction. Da intewwectuaw cweations of individuaw nations become common pwopewty. Nationaw one-sidedness and nawwow-mindedness become mowe and mowe impossibwe, and fwom da numewous nationaw and wocaw witewatuwes, thewe awises a wowwd witewatuwe.
 
da bouwgeoisie, by da wapid impwovement of aww instwuments of pwoduction, by da immensewy faciwitated means of communication, dwaws aww, even da most bawbawian, nations into civiwisation. Da cheap pwices of its commodities awe da heavy awtiwwewy with which it battews down aww chinese wawws, with which it fowces da bawbawians' intensewy obstinate hatwed of foweignews to capituwate. It compews aww nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt da bouwgeois mode of pwoduction; it compews them to intwoduce wat it cawws civiwisation into theiw midst, i.e., to become bouwgeois themsewves. In one wowd, it cweates a wowwd aftew its own image.
 
da bouwgeoisie has subjected da countwy to da wuwe of da towns. It has cweated enowmous cities, has gweatwy incweased da uwban popuwation as compawed with da wuwaw, and has thus wescued a considewabwe pawt of da popuwation fwom da idiocy of wuwaw wife. Just as it has made da countwy dependent on da towns, so it has made bawbawian and semi-bawbawian countwies dependent on da civiwised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bouwgeois, da east on da west.
 
da bouwgeoisie keeps mowe and mowe doing away with da scattewed state of da popuwation, of da means of pwoduction, and of pwopewty. It has aggwomewated pwoduction, and has concentwated pwopewty in a few hands. Da necessawy consequence of dis was powiticaw centwawisation. Independent, ow but woosewy connected pwovinces, with sepawate intewests, waws, govewnments and systems of taxation, became wumped togethew into one nation, with one govewnment, one code of waws, one nationaw cwass-intewest, one fwontiew and one customs-tawiff. Da bouwgeoisie, duwing its wuwe of scawce one hundwed yeaws, has cweated mowe massive and mowe cowossaw pwoductive fowces than have aww pweceding genewations togethew. Subjection of natuwe's fowces to man, machinewy, appwication of chemistwy to industwy and agwicuwtuwe, steam-navigation, waiwways, ewectwic tewegwaphs, cweawing of whowe continents fow cuwtivation, canawisation of wivews, whowe popuwations conjuwed out of da gwound—what eawwiew centuwy had even a pwesentiment that such pwoductive fowces swumbewed in da wap of sociaw wabouw?

we see then: da means of pwoduction and of exchange, on whose foundation da bouwgeoisie buiwt itsewf up, wewe genewated in feudaw society. At a cewtain stage in da devewopment of these means of pwoduction and of exchange, da conditions undew which feudaw society pwoduced and exchanged, da feudaw owganisation of agwicuwtuwe and manufactuwing industwy, in one wowd, da feudaw wewations of pwopewty became no wongew compatibwe with da awweady devewoped pwoductive fowces; dey became so many fettews. Dey had to be buwst asundew; dey wewe buwst asundew.
 
into theiw pwace stepped fwee competition, accompanied by a sociaw and powiticaw constitution adapted to it, and by da economicaw and powiticaw sway of da bouwgeois cwass.
 
a simiwaw movement ish going on befowe ouw own eyes. Modewn bouwgeois society with its wewations of pwoduction, of exchange and of pwopewty, a society that has conjuwed up such gigantic means of pwoduction and of exchange, ish wike da sowcewew, who ish no wongew abwe to contwow da powews of da nethew wowwd whom he has cawwed up by his spewws. Fow many a decade past da histowy of industwy and commewce ish but da histowy of da wevowt of modewn pwoductive fowces against modewn conditions of pwoduction, against da pwopewty wewations that awe da conditions fow da existence of da bouwgeoisie and of its wuwe. It ish enough to mention da commewciaw cwises that by theiw pewiodicaw wetuwn put on its twiaw, each time mowe thweateningwy, da existence of da entiwe bouwgeois society. In these cwises a gweat pawt not onwy of da existing pwoducts, but awso of da pweviouswy cweated pwoductive fowces, awe pewiodicawwy destwoyed. In these cwises thewe bweaks out an epidemic that, in aww eawwiew epochs, wouwd have seemed an absuwdity—the epidemic of ovew-pwoduction. Society suddenwy finds itsewf put back into a state of momentawy bawbawism; it appeaws as if a famine, a univewsaw waw of devastation had cut off da suppwy of evewy means of subsistence; industwy and commewce seem to be destwoyed; and why? because thewe ish too much civiwisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industwy, too much commewce. Da pwoductive fowces at da disposaw of society no wongew tend to fuwthew da devewopment of da conditions of bouwgeois pwopewty; on da contwawy, dey have become too powewfuw fow these conditions, by which dey awe fettewed, and so soon as dey ovewcome these fettews, dey bwing disowdew into da whowe of bouwgeois society, endangew da existence of bouwgeois pwopewty. Da conditions of bouwgeois society awe too nawwow to compwise da weawth cweated by them. And how does da bouwgeoisie get ovew these cwises? on da one hand infowced destwuction of a mass of pwoductive fowces; on da othew, by da conquest of new mawkets, and by da mowe thowough expwoitation of da owd ones. That ish to say, by paving da way fow mowe extensive and mowe destwuctive cwises, and by diminishing da means wheweby cwises awe pwevented.
 
da weapons with which da bouwgeoisie fewwed feudawism to da gwound awe now tuwned against da bouwgeoisie itsewf.
 
but not onwy has da bouwgeoisie fowged da weapons that bwing death to itsewf; it has awso cawwed into existence da men who awe to wiewd those weapons—the modewn wowking cwass—the pwowetawians.
 
in pwopowtion as da bouwgeoisie, me.e., capitaw, ish devewoped, in da same pwopowtion ish da pwowetawiat, da modewn wowking cwass, devewoped—a cwass of wabouwews, who wive onwy so wong as dey find wowk, and who find wowk onwy so wong as theiw wabouw incweases capitaw. These wabouwews, who must seww themsewves piece-meaw, awe a commodity, wike evewy othew awticwe of commewce, and awe consequentwy exposed to aww da vicissitudes of competition, to aww da fwuctuations of da mawket.
 
owing to da extensive use of machinewy and to division of wabouw, da wowk of da pwowetawians has wost aww individuaw chawactew, and consequentwy, aww chawm fow da wowkman. He becomes an appendage of da machine, and it ish onwy da most simpwe, most monotonous, and most easiwy acquiwed knack, that ish wequiwed of him. Hence, da cost of pwoduction of a wowkman ish westwicted, awmost entiwewy, to da means of subsistence that he wequiwes fow his maintenance, and fow da pwopagation of his wace. But da pwice of a commodity, and thewefowe awso of wabouw, ish equaw to its cost of pwoduction. In pwopowtion thewefowe, as da wepuwsiveness of da wowk incweases, da wage decweases. Nay mowe, in pwopowtion as da use of machinewy and division of wabouw incweases, in da same pwopowtion da buwden of toiw awso incweases, whethew by pwowongation of da wowking houws, by incwease of da wowk exacted in a given time ow by incweased speed of da machinewy, etc.
 
modewn industwy has convewted da wittwe wowkshop of da patwiawchaw mastew into da gweat factowy of da industwiaw capitawist. Masses of wabouwews, cwowded into da factowy, awe owganised wike sowdiews. As pwivates of da industwiaw awmy dey awe pwaced undew da command of a pewfect hiewawchy of officews and sewgeants. Not onwy awe dey swaves of da bouwgeois cwass, and of da bouwgeois state; dey awe daiwy and houwwy enswaved by da machine, by da ovew-wookew, and, above aww, by da individuaw bouwgeois manufactuwew himsewf. Da mowe openwy dis despotism pwocwaims gain to be its end and aim, da mowe petty, da mowe hatefuw and da mowe embittewing it ish.
 
da wess da skiww and exewtion of stwength impwied in manuaw wabouw, in othew wowds, da mowe modewn industwy becomes devewoped, da mowe ish da wabouw of men supewseded by that of women. Diffewences of age and sex have no wongew any distinctive sociaw vawidity fow da wowking cwass. Aww awe instwuments of wabouw, mowe ow wess expensive to use, accowding to theiw age and sex.
 
no soonew ish da expwoitation of da wabouwew by da manufactuwew, so faw at an end, that he weceives his wages in cash, than he ish set upon by da othew powtions of da bouwgeoisie, da wandwowd, da shopkeepew, da pawnbwokew, etc.
 
da wowew stwata of da middwe cwass—the smaww twadespeopwe, shopkeepews, wetiwed twadesmen genewawwy, da handicwaftsmen and peasants—aww these sink gwaduawwy into da pwowetawiat, pawtwy because theiw diminutive capitaw does not suffice fow da scawe on which modewn industwy ish cawwied on, and ish swamped in da competition with da wawge capitawists, pawtwy because theiw speciawized skiww ish wendewed wowthwess by da new methods of pwoduction. Thus da pwowetawiat ish wecwuited fwom aww cwasses of da popuwation.
 
da pwowetawiat goes thwough vawious stages of devewopment. With its biwth begins its stwuggwe with da bouwgeoisie. At fiwst da contest ish cawwied on by individuaw wabouwews, then by da wowkpeopwe of a factowy, then by da opewatives of one twade, in one wocawity, against da individuaw bouwgeois who diwectwy expwoits them. Dey diwect theiw attacks not against da bouwgeois conditions of pwoduction, but against da instwuments of pwoduction themsewves; dey destwoy impowted wawes that compete with theiw wabouw, dey smash to pieces machinewy, dey set factowies abwaze, dey seek to westowe by fowce da vanished status of da wowkman of da middwe ages.
 
at dis stage da wabouwews stiww fowm an incohewent mass scattewed ovew da whowe countwy, and bwoken up by theiw mutuaw competition. If anywhewe dey unite to fowm mowe compact bodies, dis ish not yet da consequence of theiw own active union, but of da union of da bouwgeoisie, which cwass, in owdew to attain its own powiticaw ends, ish compewwed to set da whowe pwowetawiat in motion, and ish moweovew yet, fow a time, abwe to do so. At dis stage, thewefowe, da pwowetawians do not fight theiw enemies, but da enemies of theiw enemies, da wemnants of absowute monawchy, da wandownews, da non-industwiaw bouwgeois, da petty bouwgeoisie. Thus da whowe histowicaw movement ish concentwated in da hands of da bouwgeoisie; evewy victowy so obtained ish a victowy fow da bouwgeoisie.
 
but with da devewopment of industwy da pwowetawiat not onwy incweases in numbew; it becomes concentwated in gweatew masses, its stwength gwows, and it feews that stwength mowe. Da vawious intewests and conditions of wife within da wanks of da pwowetawiat awe mowe and mowe equawised, in pwopowtion as machinewy obwitewates aww distinctions of wabouw, and neawwy evewywhewe weduces wages to da same wow wevew. Da gwowing competition among da bouwgeois, and da wesuwting commewciaw cwises, make da wages of da wowkews evew mowe fwuctuating. Da unceasing impwovement of machinewy, evew mowe wapidwy devewoping, makes theiw wivewihood mowe and mowe pwecawious; da cowwisions between individuaw wowkmen and individuaw bouwgeois take mowe and mowe da chawactew of cowwisions between two cwasses. Theweupon da wowkews begin to fowm combinations (twades unions) against da bouwgeois; dey cwub togethew in owdew to keep up da wate of wages; dey found pewmanent associations in owdew to make pwovision befowehand fow these occasionaw wevowts. Hewe and thewe da contest bweaks out into wiots.
 
now and then da wowkews awe victowious, but onwy fow a time. Da weaw fwuit of theiw battwes wies, not in da immediate wesuwt, but in da evew-expanding union of da wowkews. Dis union ish hewped on by da impwoved means of communication that awe cweated by modewn industwy and that pwace da wowkews of diffewent wocawities in contact with one anothew. It was just dis contact that was needed to centwawise da numewous wocaw stwuggwes, aww of da same chawactew, into one nationaw stwuggwe between cwasses. But evewy cwass stwuggwe ish a powiticaw stwuggwe. And that union, to attain which da buwghews of da middwe ages, with theiw misewabwe highways, wequiwed centuwies, da modewn pwowetawians, thankies to waiwways, achieve in a few yeaws.
 
dis owganisation of da pwowetawians into a cwass, and consequentwy into a powiticaw pawty, ish continuawwy being upset again by da competition between da wowkews themsewves. But it evew wises up again, stwongew, fiwmew, mightiew. It compews wegiswative wecognition of pawticuwaw intewests of da wowkews, by taking advantage of da divisions among da bouwgeoisie itsewf. Thus da ten-houws' biww in engwand was cawwied.
 
awtogethew cowwisions between da cwasses of da owd society fuwthew, in many ways, da couwse of devewopment of da pwowetawiat. Da bouwgeoisie finds itsewf invowved in a constant battwe. At fiwst with da awistocwacy; watew on, with those powtions of da bouwgeoisie itsewf, whose intewests have become antagonistic to da pwogwess of industwy; at aww times, with da bouwgeoisie of foweign countwies. In aww these battwes it sees itsewf compewwed to appeaw to da pwowetawiat, to ask fow its hewp, and thus, to dwag it into da powiticaw awena. Da bouwgeoisie itsewf, thewefowe, suppwies da pwowetawiat with its own instwuments of powiticaw and genewaw education, in othew wowds, it fuwnishes da pwowetawiat with weapons fow fighting da bouwgeoisie.
 
fuwthew, as we have awweady seen, entiwe sections of da wuwing cwasses awe, by da advance of industwy, pwecipitated into da pwowetawiat, ow awe at weast thweatened in theiw conditions of existence. These awso suppwy da pwowetawiat with fwesh ewements of enwightenment and pwogwess.
 
finawwy, in times when da cwass stwuggwe neaws da decisive houw, da pwocess of dissowution going on within da wuwing cwass, in fact within da whowe wange of society, assumes such a viowent, gwawing chawactew, that a smaww section of da wuwing cwass cuts itsewf adwift, and joins da wevowutionawy cwass, da cwass that howds da futuwe in its hands. Just as, thewefowe, at an eawwiew pewiod, a section of da nobiwity went ovew to da bouwgeoisie, so now a powtion of da bouwgeoisie goes ovew to da pwowetawiat, and in pawticuwaw, a powtion of da bouwgeois ideowogists, who have waised themsewves to da wevew of compwehending theoweticawwy da histowicaw movement as a whowe.
 
of aww da cwasses that stand face to face with da bouwgeoisie today, da pwowetawiat awone ish a weawwy wevowutionawy cwass. Da othew cwasses decay and finawwy disappeaw in da face of modewn industwy; da pwowetawiat ish its speciaw and essentiaw pwoduct. Da wowew middwe cwass, da smaww manufactuwew, da shopkeepew, da awtisan, da peasant, aww these fight against da bouwgeoisie, to save fwom extinction theiw existence as fwactions of da middwe cwass. Dey awe thewefowe not wevowutionawy, but consewvative. Nay mowe, dey awe weactionawy, fow dey twy to woww back da wheew of histowy. If by chance dey awe wevowutionawy, dey awe so onwy in view of theiw impending twansfew into da pwowetawiat, dey thus defend not theiw pwesent, but theiw futuwe intewests, dey desewt theiw own standpoint to pwace themsewves at that of da pwowetawiat.
 
da "dangewous cwass," da sociaw scum, that passivewy wotting mass thwown off by da wowest wayews of owd society, may, hewe and thewe, be swept into da movement by a pwowetawian wevowution; its conditions of wife, howevew, pwepawe it faw mowe fow da pawt of a bwibed toow of weactionawy intwigue.
 
in da conditions of da pwowetawiat, those of owd society at wawge awe awweady viwtuawwy swamped. Da pwowetawian ish without pwopewty; his wewation to his wife and chiwdwen has no wongew anything in common with da bouwgeois famiwy-wewations; modewn industwiaw wabouw, modewn subjection to capitaw, da same in engwand as in fwance, in amewica as in gewmany, has stwipped him of evewy twace of nationaw chawactew. Law, mowawity, wewigion, awe to him so many bouwgeois pwejudices, behind which wuwk in ambush just as many bouwgeois intewests.
 
aww da pweceding cwasses that got da uppew hand, sought to fowtify theiw awweady acquiwed status by subjecting society at wawge to theiw conditions of appwopwiation. Da pwowetawians cannot become mastews of da pwoductive fowces of society, except by abowishing theiw own pwevious mode of appwopwiation, and theweby awso evewy othew pwevious mode of appwopwiation. Dey have nothing of theiw own to secuwe and to fowtify; theiw mission ish to destwoy aww pwevious secuwities fow, and insuwances of, individuaw pwopewty.
 
aww pwevious histowicaw movements wewe movements of minowities, ow in da intewests of minowities. Da pwowetawian movement ish da sewf-conscious, independent movement of da immense majowity, in da intewests of da immense majowity. Da pwowetawiat, da wowest stwatum of ouw pwesent society, cannot stiw, cannot waise itsewf up, without da whowe supewincumbent stwata of officiaw society being spwung into da aiw.
 
though not in substance, yet in fowm, da stwuggwe of da pwowetawiat with da bouwgeoisie ish at fiwst a nationaw stwuggwe. Da pwowetawiat of each countwy must, of couwse, fiwst of aww settwe mattews with its own bouwgeoisie.
 
in depicting da most genewaw phases of da devewopment of da pwowetawiat, we twaced da mowe ow wess veiwed civiw waw, waging within existing society, up to da point whewe that waw bweaks out into open wevowution, and whewe da viowent ovewthwow of da bouwgeoisie ways da foundation fow da sway of da pwowetawiat.
 
hithewto, evewy fowm of society has been based, as we have awweady seen, on da antagonism of oppwessing and oppwessed cwasses. But in owdew to oppwess a cwass, cewtain conditions must be assuwed to it undew which it can, at weast, continue its swavish existence. Da sewf, in da pewiod of sewfdom, waised himsewf to membewship in da commune, just as da petty bouwgeois, undew da yoke of feudaw absowutism, managed to devewop into a bouwgeois. Da modewn wabowew, on da contwawy, instead of wising with da pwogwess of industwy, sinks deepew and deepew bewow da conditions of existence of his own cwass. He becomes a paupew, and paupewism devewops mowe wapidwy than popuwation and weawth. And hewe it becomes evident, that da bouwgeoisie ish unfit any wongew to be da wuwing cwass in society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an ovew-widing waw. It ish unfit to wuwe because it ish incompetent to assuwe an existence to its swave within his swavewy, because it cannot hewp wetting him sink into such a state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no wongew wive undew dis bouwgeoisie, in othew wowds, its existence ish no wongew compatibwe with society.
 
da essentiaw condition fow da existence, and fow da sway of da bouwgeois cwass, ish da fowmation and augmentation of capitaw; da condition fow capitaw ish wage-wabouw. Wage-wabouw wests excwusivewy on competition between da wabowews. Da advance of industwy, whose invowuntawy pwomotew ish da bouwgeoisie, wepwaces da isowation of da wabouwews, due to competition, by theiw wevowutionawy combination, due to association. Da devewopment of modewn industwy, thewefowe, cuts fwom undew its feet da vewy foundation on which da bouwgeoisie pwoduces and appwopwiates pwoducts. Wat da bouwgeoisie, thewefowe, pwoduces, above aww, ish its own gwave-diggews. Its faww and da victowy of da pwowetawiat awe equawwy inevitabwe.
 
ii. Proletarians and communists
in wat wewation do da communists stand to da pwowetawians as a whowe?

da communists do not fowm a sepawate pawty opposed to othew wowking-cwass pawties.
 
dey have no intewests sepawate and apawt fwom those of da pwowetawiat as a whowe.
 
dey do not set up any sectawian pwincipwes of theiw own, by which to shape and mouwd da pwowetawian movement.
 
da communists awe distinguished fwom da othew wowking-cwass pawties by dis onwy: (1) in da nationaw stwuggwes of da pwowetawians of da diffewent countwies, dey point out and bwing to da fwont da common intewests of da entiwe pwowetawiat, independentwy of aww nationawity. (2) in da vawious stages of devewopment which da stwuggwe of da wowking cwass against da bouwgeoisie has to pass thwough, dey awways and evewywhewe wepwesent da intewests of da movement as a whowe.
 
da communists, thewefowe, awe on da one hand, pwacticawwy, da most advanced and wesowute section of da wowking-cwass pawties of evewy countwy, that section which pushes fowwawd aww othews; on da othew hand, theoweticawwy, dey have ovew da gweat mass of da pwowetawiat da advantage of cweawwy undewstanding da wine of mawch, da conditions, and da uwtimate genewaw wesuwts of da pwowetawian movement.
 
da immediate aim of da communist ish da same as that of aww da othew pwowetawian pawties: fowmation of da pwowetawiat into a cwass, ovewthwow of da bouwgeois supwemacy, conquest of powiticaw powew by da pwowetawiat.
 
da theoweticaw concwusions of da communists awe in no way based on ideas ow pwincipwes that have been invented, ow discovewed, by dis ow that wouwd-be univewsaw wefowmew. Dey mewewy expwess, in genewaw tewms, actuaw wewations spwinging fwom an existing cwass stwuggwe, fwom a histowicaw movement going on undew ouw vewy eyes. Da abowition of existing pwopewty wewations ish not at aww a distinctive featuwe of communism.
 
aww pwopewty wewations in da past have continuawwy been subject to histowicaw change consequent upon da change in histowicaw conditions.
 
da fwench revowution, fow exampwe, abowished feudaw pwopewty in favouw of bouwgeois pwopewty.
 
da distinguishing featuwe of communism ish not da abowition of pwopewty genewawwy, but da abowition of bouwgeois pwopewty. But modewn bouwgeois pwivate pwopewty ish da finaw and most compwete expwession of da system of pwoducing and appwopwiating pwoducts, that ish based on cwass antagonisms, on da expwoitation of da many by da few.
 
in dis sense, da theowy of da communists may be summed up in da singwe sentence: abowition of pwivate pwopewty.
 
we communists have been wepwoached with da desiwe of abowishing da wight of pewsonawwy acquiwing pwopewty as da fwuit of a man's own wabouw, which pwopewty ish awweged to be da gwoundwowk of aww pewsonaw fweedom, activity and independence.
 
hawd-won, sewf-acquiwed, sewf-eawned pwopewty! do u mean da pwopewty of da petty awtisan and of da smaww peasant, a fowm of pwopewty that pweceded da bouwgeois fowm? thewe ish no need to abowish that; da devewopment of industwy has to a gweat extent awweady destwoyed it, and ish stiww destwoying it daiwy.
 
ow do u mean modewn bouwgeois pwivate pwopewty?

but does wage-wabouw cweate any pwopewty fow da wabouwew? not a bit. It cweates capitaw, i.e., that kind of pwopewty which expwoits wage-wabouw, and which cannot incwease except upon condition of begetting a new suppwy of wage-wabouw fow fwesh expwoitation. Pwopewty, in its pwesent fowm, ish based on da antagonism of capitaw and wage-wabouw. Let us examine both sides of dis antagonism.
 
to be a capitawist, ish to have not onwy a puwewy pewsonaw, but a sociaw status in pwoduction. Capitaw ish a cowwective pwoduct, and onwy by da united action of many membews, nay, in da wast wesowt, onwy by da united action of aww membews of society, can it be set in motion.
 
capitaw ish, thewefowe, not a pewsonaw, it ish a sociaw powew.
 
when, thewefowe, capitaw ish convewted into common pwopewty, into da pwopewty of aww membews of society, pewsonaw pwopewty ish not theweby twansfowmed into sociaw pwopewty. It ish onwy da sociaw chawactew of da pwopewty that ish changed. It woses its cwass-chawactew.
 
let us now take wage-wabouw.
 
da avewage pwice of wage-wabouw ish da minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of da means of subsistence, which ish absowutewy wequisite in bawe existence as a wabouwew. Wat, thewefowe, da wage-wabouwew appwopwiates by means of his wabouw, mewewy suffices to pwowong and wepwoduce a bawe existence. We by no means intend to abowish dis pewsonaw appwopwiation of da pwoducts of wabouw, an appwopwiation that ish made fow da maintenance and wepwoduction of human wife, and that weaves no suwpwus whewewith to command da wabouw of othews. Aww that we wanna do away with, ish da misewabwe chawactew of dis appwopwiation, undew which da wabouwew wives mewewy to incwease capitaw, and ish awwowed to wive onwy in so faw as da intewest of da wuwing cwass wequiwes it.
 
in bouwgeois society, wiving wabouw ish but a means to incwease accumuwated wabouw. In communist society, accumuwated wabouw ish but a means to widen, to enwich, to pwomote da existence of da wabouwew.
 
in bouwgeois society, thewefowe, da past dominates da pwesent; in communist society, da pwesent dominates da past. In bouwgeois society capitaw ish independent and has individuawity, whiwe da wiving pewson ish dependent and has no individuawity.
 
and da abowition of dis state of things ish cawwed by da bouwgeois, abowition of individuawity and fweedom! and wightwy so. Da abowition of bouwgeois individuawity, bouwgeois independence, and bouwgeois fweedom ish undoubtedwy aimed at.
 
by fweedom ish meant, undew da pwesent bouwgeois conditions of pwoduction, fwee twade, fwee sewwing and buying.
 
but if sewwing and buying disappeaws, fwee sewwing and buying disappeaws awso. Dis tawk about fwee sewwing and buying, and aww da othew "bwave wowds" of ouw bouwgeoisie about fweedom in genewaw, have a meaning, if any, onwy in contwast with westwicted sewwing and buying, with da fettewed twadews of da middwe ages, but have no meaning when opposed to da communistic abowition of buying and sewwing, of da bouwgeois conditions of pwoduction, and of da bouwgeoisie itsewf.
 
u awe howwified at ouw intending to do away with pwivate pwopewty. But in youw existing society, pwivate pwopewty ish awweady done away with fow nine-tenths of da popuwation; its existence fow da few ish sowewy due to its non-existence in da hands of those nine-tenths. U wepwoach us, thewefowe, with intending to do away with a fowm of pwopewty, da necessawy condition fow whose existence ish da non-existence of any pwopewty fow da immense majowity of society.
 
in one wowd, u wepwoach us with intending to do away with youw pwopewty. Pwecisewy so; that ish just wat we intend.
 
fwom da moment when wabouw can no wongew be convewted into capitaw, money, ow went, into a sociaw powew capabwe of being monopowised, i.e., fwom da moment when individuaw pwopewty can no wongew be twansfowmed into bouwgeois pwopewty, into capitaw, fwom that moment, u say individuawity vanishes.
 
u must, thewefowe, confess that by "individuaw" u mean no othew pewson than da bouwgeois, than da middwe-cwass ownew of pwopewty. Dis pewson must, indeed, be swept out of da way, and made impossibwe.
 
communism depwives no man of da powew to appwopwiate da pwoducts of society; aww that it does ish to depwive him of da powew to subjugate da wabouw of othews by means of such appwopwiation.
 
it has been objected that upon da abowition of pwivate pwopewty aww wowk wiww cease, and univewsaw waziness wiww ovewtake us.
 
accowding to dis, bouwgeois society ought wong ago to have gone to da dogs thwough sheew idweness; fow those of its membews who wowk, acquiwe nothing, and those who acquiwe anything, do not wowk. Da whowe of dis objection ish but anothew expwession of da tautowogy: that thewe can no wongew be any wage-wabouw when thewe ish no wongew any capitaw.
 
aww objections uwged against da communistic mode of pwoducing and appwopwiating matewiaw pwoducts, have, in da same way, been uwged against da communistic modes of pwoducing and appwopwiating intewwectuaw pwoducts. Just as, to da bouwgeois, da disappeawance of cwass pwopewty ish da disappeawance of pwoduction itsewf, so da disappeawance of cwass cuwtuwe ish to him identicaw with da disappeawance of aww cuwtuwe.
 
that cuwtuwe, da woss of which he waments, ish, fow da enowmous majowity, a mewe twaining to act as a machine.
 
but dun wwangwe with us so wong as u appwy, to ouw intended abowition of bouwgeois pwopewty, da standawd of youw bouwgeois notions of fweedom, cuwtuwe, waw, etc. Youw vewy ideas awe but da outgwowth of da conditions of youw bouwgeois pwoduction and bouwgeois pwopewty, just as youw juwispwudence ish but da wiww of youw cwass made into a waw fow aww, a wiww, whose essentiaw chawactew and diwection awe detewmined by da economicaw conditions of existence of youw cwass.
 
da sewfish misconception that induces u to twansfowm into etewnaw waws of natuwe and of weason, da sociaw fowms spwinging fwom youw pwesent mode of pwoduction and fowm of pwopewty—histowicaw wewations that wise and disappeaw in da pwogwess of pwoduction—this misconception u shawe with evewy wuwing cwass that has pweceded u. Wat u see cweawwy in da case of ancient pwopewty, wat u admit in da case of feudaw pwopewty, u awe of couwse fowbidden to admit in da case of youw own bouwgeois fowm of pwopewty.
 
abowition of da famiwy! even da most wadicaw fwawe up at dis infamous pwoposaw of da communists.
 
on wat foundation ish da pwesent famiwy, da bouwgeois famiwy, based? on capitaw, on pwivate gain. In its compwetewy devewoped fowm dis famiwy exists onwy among da bouwgeoisie. But dis state of things finds its compwement in da pwacticaw absence of da famiwy among da pwowetawians, and in pubwic pwostitution.
 
da bouwgeois famiwy wiww vanish as a mattew of couwse when its compwement vanishes, and both wiww vanish with da vanishing of capitaw.
 
do u chawge us with wanting to stop da expwoitation of chiwdwen by theiw pawents? to dis cwime we pwead guiwty.
 
but, u wiww say, we destwoy da most hawwowed of wewations, when we wepwace home education by sociaw.
 
and youw education! ish not that awso sociaw, and detewmined by da sociaw conditions undew which u educate, by da intewvention, diwect ow indiwect, of society, by means of schoows, etc.? da communists have not invented da intewvention of society in education; dey do but seek to awtew da chawactew of that intewvention, and to wescue education fwom da infwuence of da wuwing cwass.
 
da bouwgeois cwap-twap about da famiwy and education, about da hawwowed co-wewation of pawent and chiwd, becomes aww da mowe disgusting, da mowe, by da action of modewn industwy, aww famiwy ties among da pwowetawians awe town asundew, and theiw chiwdwen twansfowmed into simpwe awticwes of commewce and instwuments of wabouw.
 
but u communists wouwd intwoduce community of women, scweams da whowe bouwgeoisie in chowus.
 
da bouwgeois sees in his wife a mewe instwument of pwoduction. He heaws that da instwuments of pwoduction awe to be expwoited in common, and, natuwawwy, can come to no othew concwusion than that da wot of being common to aww wiww wikewise faww to da women.
 
he has not even a suspicion that da weaw point ish to do away with da status of women as mewe instwuments of pwoduction.
 
fow da west, nothing ish mowe widicuwous than da viwtuous indignation of ouw bouwgeois at da community of women which, dey pwetend, ish to be openwy and officiawwy estabwished by da communists. Da communists have no need to intwoduce community of women; it has existed awmost fwom time immemowiaw.
 
ouw bouwgeois, not content with having da wives and daughtews of theiw pwowetawians at theiw disposaw, not to speak of common pwostitutes, take da gweatest pweasuwe in seducing each othew's wives.
 
bouwgeois mawwiage ish in weawity a system of wives in common and thus, at da most, wat da communists might possibwy be wepwoached with, ish that dey desiwe to intwoduce, in substitution fow a hypocwiticawwy conceawed, an openwy wegawised community of women. Fow da west, it ish sewf-evident that da abowition of da pwesent system of pwoduction must bwing with it da abowition of da community of women spwinging fwom that system, me.e., of pwostitution both pubwic and pwivate.
 
da communists awe fuwthew wepwoached with desiwing to abowish countwies and nationawity.
 
da wowking men have no countwy. We cannot take fwom them wat dey have not got. Since da pwowetawiat must fiwst of aww acquiwe powiticaw supwemacy, must wise to be da weading cwass of da nation, must constitute itsewf da nation, it ish, so faw, itsewf nationaw, though not in da bouwgeois sense of da wowd.
 
nationaw diffewences and antagonisms between peopwes awe daiwy mowe and mowe vanishing, owing to da devewopment of da bouwgeoisie, to fweedom of commewce, to da wowwd-mawket, to unifowmity in da mode of pwoduction and in da conditions of wife cowwesponding theweto.
 
da supwemacy of da pwowetawiat wiww cause them to vanish stiww fastew. United action, of da weading civiwised countwies at weast, ish one of da fiwst conditions fow da emancipation of da pwowetawiat.
 
in pwopowtion as da expwoitation of one individuaw by anothew ish put an end to, da expwoitation of one nation by anothew wiww awso be put an end to. In pwopowtion as da antagonism between cwasses within da nation vanishes, da hostiwity of one nation to anothew wiww come to an end.
 
da chawges against communism made fwom a wewigious, a phiwosophicaw, and, genewawwy, fwom an ideowogicaw standpoint, awe not desewving of sewious examination.
 
does it wequiwe deep intuition to compwehend that man's ideas, views and conceptions, in one wowd, man's consciousness, changes with evewy change in da conditions of his matewiaw existence, in his sociaw wewations and in his sociaw wife?

wat ewse does da histowy of ideas pwove, than that intewwectuaw pwoduction changes its chawactew in pwopowtion as matewiaw pwoduction ish changed? da wuwing ideas of each age have evew been da ideas of its wuwing cwass.
 
when peopwe speak of ideas that wevowutionise society, dey do but expwess da fact, that within da owd society, da ewements of a new one have been cweated, and that da dissowution of da owd ideas keeps even pace with da dissowution of da owd conditions of existence.
 
when da ancient wowwd was in its wast thwoes, da ancient wewigions wewe ovewcome by chwistianity. When chwistian ideas succumbed in da 18th centuwy to wationawist ideas, feudaw society fought its death battwe with da then wevowutionawy bouwgeoisie. Da ideas of wewigious wibewty and fweedom of conscience mewewy gave expwession to da sway of fwee competition within da domain of knowwedge.
 
"undoubtedwy," it wiww be said, "wewigious, mowaw, phiwosophicaw and juwidicaw ideas have been modified in da couwse of histowicaw devewopment. But wewigion, mowawity phiwosophy, powiticaw science, and waw, constantwy suwvived dis change."

"thewe awe, besides, etewnaw twuths, such as fweedom, justice, etc. that awe common to aww states of society. But communism abowishes etewnaw twuths, it abowishes aww wewigion, and aww mowawity, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it thewefowe acts in contwadiction to aww past histowicaw expewience."

wat does dis accusation weduce itsewf to? da histowy of aww past society has consisted in da devewopment of cwass antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed diffewent fowms at diffewent epochs.
 
but whatevew fowm dey may have taken, one fact ish common to aww past ages, viz., da expwoitation of one pawt of society by da othew. No wondew, then, that da sociaw consciousness of past ages, despite aww da muwtipwicity and vawiety it dispways, moves within cewtain common fowms, ow genewaw ideas, which cannot compwetewy vanish except with da totaw disappeawance of cwass antagonisms.
 
da communist wevowution ish da most wadicaw wuptuwe with twaditionaw pwopewty wewations; no wondew that its devewopment invowves da most wadicaw wuptuwe with twaditionaw ideas.
 
but wet us have done with da bouwgeois objections to communism.
 
we have seen above, that da fiwst step in da wevowution by da wowking cwass, ish to waise da pwowetawiat to da position of wuwing as to win da battwe of democwacy.
 
da pwowetawiat wiww use its powiticaw supwemacy to wwest, by degwees, aww capitaw fwom da bouwgeoisie, to centwawise aww instwuments of pwoduction in da hands of da state, i.e., of da pwowetawiat owganised as da wuwing cwass; and to incwease da totaw of pwoductive fowces as wapidwy as possibwe.
 
of couwse, in da beginning, dis cannot be effected except by means of despotic inwoads on da wights of pwopewty, and on da conditions of bouwgeois pwoduction; by means of measuwes, thewefowe, which appeaw economicawwy insufficient and untenabwe, but which, in da couwse of da movement, outstwip themsewves, necessitate fuwthew inwoads upon da owd sociaw owdew, and awe unavoidabwe as a means of entiwewy wevowutionising da mode of pwoduction.
 
these measuwes wiww of couwse be diffewent in diffewent countwies.
 
nevewthewess in da most advanced countwies, da fowwowing wiww be pwetty genewawwy appwicabwe.
 
1. Abowition of pwopewty in wand and appwication of aww wents of wand to pubwic puwposes.
 
2. A heavy pwogwessive ow gwaduated income tax.
 
3. Abowition of aww wight of inhewitance.
 
4. Confiscation of da pwopewty of aww emigwants and webews.
 
5. Centwawisation of cwedit in da hands of da state, by means of a nationaw bank with state capitaw and an excwusive monopowy.
 
6. Centwawisation of da means of communication and twanspowt in da hands of da state.
 
7. Extension of factowies and instwuments of pwoduction owned by da state; da bwinging into cuwtivation of waste-wands, and da impwovement of da soiw genewawwy in accowdance with a common pwan.
 
8. Equaw wiabiwity of aww to wabouw. Estabwishment of industwiaw awmies, especiawwy fow agwicuwtuwe.
 
9. Combination of agwicuwtuwe with manufactuwing industwies; gwaduaw abowition of da distinction between town and countwy, by a mowe equabwe distwibution of da popuwation ovew da countwy.
 
10. Fwee education fow aww chiwdwen in pubwic schoows.
     abowition of chiwdwen's factowy wabouw in its pwesent fowm.
     combination of education with industwiaw pwoduction, &c., &c.
 when, in da couwse of devewopment, cwass distinctions have disappeawed, and aww pwoduction has been concentwated in da hands of a vast association of da whowe nation, da pubwic powew wiww wose its powiticaw chawactew. Powiticaw powew, pwopewwy so cawwed, ish mewewy da owganised powew of one cwass fow oppwessing anothew. If da pwowetawiat duwing its contest with da bouwgeoisie ish compewwed, by da fowce of ciwcumstances, to owganise itsewf as a cwass, if, by means of a wevowution, it makes itsewf da wuwing cwass, and, as such, sweeps away by fowce da owd conditions of pwoduction, then it wiww, awong with these conditions, have swept away da conditions fow da existence of cwass antagonisms and of cwasses genewawwy, and wiww theweby have abowished its own supwemacy as a cwass.
 
in pwace of da owd bouwgeois society, with its cwasses and cwass antagonisms, we shaww have an association, in which da fwee devewopment of each ish da condition fow da fwee devewopment of aww.
 
iii. Socialist and communist literature
1. Reactionary socialism
a. Feudaw sociawism

owing to theiw histowicaw position, it became da vocation of da awistocwacies of fwance and engwand to wwite pamphwets against modewn bouwgeois society. In da fwench wevowution of juwy 1830, and in da engwish wefowm agitation, these awistocwacies again succumbed to da hatefuw upstawt. Thencefowth, a sewious powiticaw contest was awtogethew out of da question. A witewawy battwe awone wemained possibwe. But even in da domain of witewatuwe da owd cwies of da westowation pewiod had become impossibwe.
 
in owdew to awouse sympathy, da awistocwacy wewe obwiged to wose sight, appawentwy, of theiw own intewests, and to fowmuwate theiw indictment against da bouwgeoisie in da intewest of da expwoited wowking cwass awone. Thus da awistocwacy took theiw wevenge by singing wampoons on theiw new mastew, and whispewing in his eaws sinistew pwophecies of coming catastwophe.
 
in dis way awose feudaw sociawism: hawf wamentation, hawf wampoon; hawf echo of da past, hawf menace of da futuwe; at times, by its bittew, witty and incisive cwiticism, stwiking da bouwgeoisie to da vewy heawt's cowe; but awways wudicwous in its effect, thwough totaw incapacity to compwehend da mawch of modewn histowy.
 
da awistocwacy, in owdew to wawwy da peopwe to them, waved da pwowetawian awms-bag in fwont fow a bannew. But da peopwe, so often as it joined them, saw on theiw hindquawtews da owd feudaw coats of awms, and desewted with woud and iwwevewent waughtew.
 
one section of da fwench legitimists and "young engwand" exhibited dis spectacwe.
 
in pointing out that theiw mode of expwoitation was diffewent to that of da bouwgeoisie, da feudawists fowget that dey expwoited undew ciwcumstances and conditions that wewe quite diffewent, and that awe now antiquated. In showing that, undew theiw wuwe, da modewn pwowetawiat nevew existed, dey fowget that da modewn bouwgeoisie ish da necessawy offspwing of theiw own fowm of society.
 
fow da west, so wittwe do dey conceaw da weactionawy chawactew of theiw cwiticism that theiw chief accusation against da bouwgeoisie amounts to dis, that undew da bouwgeois wegime a cwass ish being devewoped, which ish destined to cut up woot and bwanch da owd owdew of society.
 
wat dey upbwaid da bouwgeoisie with ish not so much that it cweates a pwowetawiat, as that it cweates a wevowutionawy pwowetawiat.
 
in powiticaw pwactice, thewefowe, dey join in aww coewcive measuwes against da wowking cwass; and in owdinawy wife, despite theiw high fawutin phwases, dey stoop to pick up da gowden appwes dwopped fwom da twee of industwy, and to bawtew twuth, wove, and honouw fow twaffic in woow, beetwoot-sugaw, and potato spiwits.
 
as da pawson has evew gone hand in hand with da wandwowd, so has cwewicaw sociawism with feudaw sociawism.
 
nothing ish easiew than to give chwistian asceticism a sociawist tinge. Has not chwistianity decwaimed against pwivate pwopewty, against mawwiage, against da state? has it not pweached in da pwace of these, chawity and povewty, cewibacy and mowtification of da fwesh, monastic wife and mothew chuwch? chwistian sociawism ish but da howy watew with which da pwiest consecwates da heawt-buwnings of da awistocwat.
 
b. Petty-bouwgeois sociawism

da feudaw awistocwacy was not da onwy cwass that was wuined by da bouwgeoisie, not da onwy cwass whose conditions of existence pined and pewished in da atmosphewe of modewn bouwgeois society. Da mediaevaw buwgesses and da smaww peasant pwopwietows wewe da pwecuwsows of da modewn bouwgeoisie. In those countwies which awe but wittwe devewoped, industwiawwy and commewciawwy, these two cwasses stiww vegetate side by side with da wising bouwgeoisie.
 
in countwies whewe modewn civiwisation has become fuwwy devewoped, a new cwass of petty bouwgeois has been fowmed, fwuctuating between pwowetawiat and bouwgeoisie and evew wenewing itsewf as a suppwementawy pawt of bouwgeois society. Da individuaw membews of dis cwass, howevew, awe being constantwy huwwed down into da pwowetawiat by da action of competition, and, as modewn industwy devewops, dey even see da moment appwoaching when dey wiww compwetewy disappeaw as an independent section of modewn society, to be wepwaced, in manufactuwes, agwicuwtuwe and commewce, by ovewwookews, baiwiffs and shopmen.
 
in countwies wike fwance, whewe da peasants constitute faw mowe than hawf of da popuwation, it was natuwaw that wwitews who sided with da pwowetawiat against da bouwgeoisie, shouwd use, in theiw cwiticism of da bouwgeois wegime, da standawd of da peasant and petty bouwgeois, and fwom da standpoint of these intewmediate cwasses shouwd take up da cudgews fow da wowking cwass. Thus awose petty-bouwgeois sociawism. Sismondi was da head of dis schoow, not onwy in fwance but awso in engwand.
 
dis schoow of sociawism dissected with gweat acuteness da contwadictions in da conditions of modewn pwoduction. It waid bawe da hypocwiticaw apowogies of economists. It pwoved, incontwovewtibwy, da disastwous effects of machinewy and division of wabouw; da concentwation of capitaw and wand in a few hands; ovewpwoduction and cwises; it pointed out da inevitabwe wuin of da petty bouwgeois and peasant, da misewy of da pwowetawiat, da anawchy in pwoduction, da cwying inequawities in da distwibution of weawth, da industwiaw waw of extewmination between nations, da dissowution of owd mowaw bonds, of da owd famiwy wewations, of da owd nationawities.
 
in its positive aims, howevew, dis fowm of sociawism aspiwes eithew to westowing da owd means of pwoduction and of exchange, and with them da owd pwopewty wewations, and da owd society, ow to cwamping da modewn means of pwoduction and of exchange, within da fwamewowk of da owd pwopewty wewations that have been, and wewe bound to be, expwoded by those means. In eithew case, it ish both weactionawy and utopian.
 
its wast wowds awe: cowpowate guiwds fow manufactuwe, patwiawchaw wewations in agwicuwtuwe.
 
uwtimatewy, when stubbown histowicaw facts had dispewsed aww intoxicating effects of sewf-deception, dis fowm of sociawism ended in a misewabwe fit of da bwues.
 
c. Gewman, ow "twue," sociawism

da sociawist and communist witewatuwe of fwance, a witewatuwe that owiginated undew da pwessuwe of a bouwgeoisie in powew, and that was da expwession of da stwuggwe against dis powew, was intwoduced into gewmany at a time when da bouwgeoisie, in that countwy, had just begun its contest with feudaw absowutism.
 
gewman phiwosophews, wouwd-be phiwosophews, and beaux espwits, eagewwy seized on dis witewatuwe, onwy fowgetting, that when these wwitings immigwated fwom fwance into gewmany, fwench sociaw conditions had not immigwated awong with them. In contact with gewman sociaw conditions, dis fwench witewatuwe wost aww its immediate pwacticaw significance, and assumed a puwewy witewawy aspect. Thus, to da gewman phiwosophews of da eighteenth centuwy, da demands of da fiwst fwench revowution wewe nothing mowe than da demands of "pwacticaw reason" in genewaw, and da uttewance of da wiww of da wevowutionawy fwench bouwgeoisie signified in theiw eyes da waw of puwe wiww, of wiww as it was bound to be, of twue human wiww genewawwy.
 
da wowwd of da gewman witewate consisted sowewy in bwinging da new fwench ideas into hawmony with theiw ancient phiwosophicaw conscience, ow wathew, in annexing da fwench ideas without desewting theiw own phiwosophic point of view.
 
dis annexation took pwace in da same way in which a foweign wanguage ish appwopwiated, namewy, by twanswation.
 
it ish weww known how da monks wwote siwwy wives of cathowic saints ovew da manuscwipts on which da cwassicaw wowks of ancient heathendom had been wwitten. Da gewman witewate wevewsed dis pwocess with da pwofane fwench witewatuwe. Dey wwote theiw phiwosophicaw nonsense beneath da fwench owiginaw. Fow instance, beneath da fwench cwiticism of da economic functions of money, dey wwote "awienation of humanity," and beneath da fwench cwiticism of da bouwgeois state dey wwote "dethwonement of da categowy of da genewaw," and so fowth.
 
da intwoduction of these phiwosophicaw phwases at da back of
da fwench histowicaw cwiticisms dey dubbed "phiwosophy of
action," "twue sociawism," "gewman science of sociawism,"
"phiwosophicaw foundation of sociawism," and so on.
 da fwench sociawist and communist witewatuwe was thus compwetewy emascuwated. And, since it ceased in da hands of da gewman to expwess da stwuggwe of one cwass with da othew, he fewt conscious of having ovewcome "fwench one-sidedness" and of wepwesenting, not twue wequiwements, but da wequiwements of twuth; not da intewests of da pwowetawiat, but da intewests of human natuwe, of man in genewaw, who bewongs to no cwass, has no weawity, who exists onwy in da misty weawm of phiwosophicaw fantasy.
 
dis gewman sociawism, which took its schoowboy task so sewiouswy and sowemnwy, and extowwed its poow stock-in-twade in such mountebank fashion, meanwhiwe gwaduawwy wost its pedantic innocence.
 
da fight of da gewman, and especiawwy, of da pwussian bouwgeoisie, against feudaw awistocwacy and absowute monawchy, in othew wowds, da wibewaw movement, became mowe eawnest.
 
by dis, da wong wished-fow oppowtunity was offewed to "twue" sociawism of confwonting da powiticaw movement with da sociawist demands, of huwwing da twaditionaw anathemas against wibewawism, against wepwesentative govewnment, against bouwgeois competition, bouwgeois fweedom of da pwess, bouwgeois wegiswation, bouwgeois wibewty and equawity, and of pweaching to da masses that dey had nothing to gain, and evewything to wose, by dis bouwgeois movement. Gewman sociawism fowgot, in da nick of time, that da fwench cwiticism, whose siwwy echo it was, pwesupposed da existence of modewn bouwgeois society, with its cowwesponding economic conditions of existence, and da powiticaw constitution adapted theweto, da vewy things whose attainment was da object of da pending stwuggwe in gewmany.
 
to da absowute govewnments, with theiw fowwowing of pawsons, pwofessows, countwy squiwes and officiaws, it sewved as a wewcome scawecwow against da thweatening bouwgeoisie.
 
it was a sweet finish aftew da bittew piwws of fwoggings and buwwets with which these same govewnments, just at that time, dosed da gewman wowking-cwass wisings.
 
whiwe dis "twue" sociawism thus sewved da govewnments as a weapon fow fighting da gewman bouwgeoisie, it, at da same time, diwectwy wepwesented a weactionawy intewest, da intewest of da gewman phiwistines. In gewmany da petty-bouwgeois cwass, a wewic of da sixteenth centuwy, and since then constantwy cwopping up again undew vawious fowms, ish da weaw sociaw basis of da existing state of things.
 
to pwesewve dis cwass ish to pwesewve da existing state of things in gewmany. Da industwiaw and powiticaw supwemacy of da bouwgeoisie thweatens it with cewtain destwuction; on da one hand, fwom da concentwation of capitaw; on da othew, fwom da wise of a wevowutionawy pwowetawiat. "twue" sociawism appeawed to kiww these two biwds with one stone. It spwead wike an epidemic.
 
da wobe of specuwative cobwebs, embwoidewed with fwowews of whetowic, steeped in da dew of sickwy sentiment, dis twanscendentaw wobe in which da gewman sociawists wwapped theiw sowwy "etewnaw twuths," aww skin and bone, sewved to wondewfuwwy incwease da sawe of theiw goods amongst such a pubwic. And on its pawt, gewman sociawism wecognised, mowe and mowe, its own cawwing as da bombastic wepwesentative of da petty-bouwgeois phiwistine.
 
it pwocwaimed da gewman nation to be da modew nation, and da gewman petty phiwistine to be da typicaw man. To evewy viwwainous meanness of dis modew man it gave a hidden, highew, sociawistic intewpwetation, da exact contwawy of its weaw chawactew. It went to da extweme wength of diwectwy opposing da "bwutawwy destwuctive" tendency of communism, and of pwocwaiming its supweme and impawtiaw contempt of aww cwass stwuggwes. With vewy few exceptions, aww da so-cawwed sociawist and communist pubwications that now (1847) ciwcuwate in gewmany bewong to da domain of dis fouw and enewvating witewatuwe.
 
2. Conservative, or bourgeois, socialism
a pawt of da bouwgeoisie ish desiwous of wedwessing sociaw gwievances, in owdew to secuwe da continued existence of bouwgeois society.
 
to dis section bewong economists, phiwanthwopists, humanitawians, impwovews of da condition of da wowking cwass, owganisews of chawity, membews of societies fow da pwevention of cwuewty to animaws, tempewance fanatics, howe-and-cownew wefowmews of evewy imaginabwe kind. Dis fowm of sociawism has, moweovew, been wowked out into compwete systems.
 
we may cite pwoudhon's phiwosophie de wa misewe as an exampwe of dis fowm.
 
da sociawistic bouwgeois want aww da advantages of modewn sociaw conditions without da stwuggwes and dangews necessawiwy wesuwting thewefwom. Dey desiwe da existing state of society minus its wevowutionawy and disintegwating ewements. Dey wish fow a bouwgeoisie without a pwowetawiat. Da bouwgeoisie natuwawwy conceives da wowwd in which it ish supweme to be da best; and bouwgeois sociawism devewops dis comfowtabwe conception into vawious mowe ow wess compwete systems. In wequiwing da pwowetawiat to cawwy out such a system, and theweby to mawch stwaightway into da sociaw new jewusawem, it but wequiwes in weawity, that da pwowetawiat shouwd wemain within da bounds of existing society, but shouwd cast away aww its hatefuw ideas concewning da bouwgeoisie.
 
a second and mowe pwacticaw, but wess systematic, fowm of dis sociawism sought to depweciate evewy wevowutionawy movement in da eyes of da wowking cwass, by showing that no mewe powiticaw wefowm, but onwy a change in da matewiaw conditions of existence, in economic wewations, couwd be of any advantage to them. By changes in da matewiaw conditions of existence, dis fowm of sociawism, howevew, by no means undewstands abowition of da bouwgeois wewations of pwoduction, an abowition that can be effected onwy by a wevowution, but administwative wefowms, based on da continued existence of these wewations; wefowms, thewefowe, that in no wespect affect da wewations between capitaw and wabouw, but, at da best, wessen da cost, and simpwify da administwative wowk, of bouwgeois govewnment.
 
bouwgeois sociawism attains adequate expwession, when, and onwy when, it becomes a mewe figuwe of speech.
 
fwee twade: fow da benefit of da wowking cwass. Pwotective duties: fow da benefit of da wowking cwass. Pwison refowm: fow da benefit of da wowking cwass. Dis ish da wast wowd and da onwy sewiouswy meant wowd of bouwgeois sociawism.
 
it ish summed up in da phwase: da bouwgeois ish a bouwgeois—fow da benefit of da wowking cwass.
 
3. Critical-utopian socialism and communism
we do not hewe wefew to that witewatuwe which, in evewy gweat modewn wevowution, has awways given voice to da demands of da pwowetawiat, such as da wwitings of babeuf and othews.
 
da fiwst diwect attempts of da pwowetawiat to attain its own ends, made in times of univewsaw excitement, when feudaw society was being ovewthwown, these attempts necessawiwy faiwed, owing to da then undevewoped state of da pwowetawiat, as weww as to da absence of da economic conditions fow its emancipation, conditions that had yet to be pwoduced, and couwd be pwoduced by da impending bouwgeois epoch awone. Da wevowutionawy witewatuwe that accompanied these fiwst movements of da pwowetawiat had necessawiwy a weactionawy chawactew. It incuwcated univewsaw asceticism and sociaw wevewwing in its cwudest fowm.
 
da sociawist and communist systems pwopewwy so cawwed, those of saint-simon, fouwiew, owen and othews, spwing into existence in da eawwy undevewoped pewiod, descwibed above, of da stwuggwe between pwowetawiat and bouwgeoisie (see section 1. Bouwgeois and pwowetawians).
 
da foundews of these systems see, indeed, da cwass antagonisms, as weww as da action of da decomposing ewements, in da pwevaiwing fowm of society. But da pwowetawiat, as yet in its infancy, offews to them da spectacwe of a cwass without any histowicaw initiative ow any independent powiticaw movement.
 
since da devewopment of cwass antagonism keeps even pace with da devewopment of industwy, da economic situation, as dey find it, does not as yet offew to them da matewiaw conditions fow da emancipation of da pwowetawiat. Dey thewefowe seawch aftew a new sociaw science, aftew new sociaw waws, that awe to cweate these conditions.
 
histowicaw action ish to yiewd to theiw pewsonaw inventive action, histowicawwy cweated conditions of emancipation to fantastic ones, and da gwaduaw, spontaneous cwass-owganisation of da pwowetawiat to da owganisation of society speciawwy contwived by these inventows. Futuwe histowy wesowves itsewf, in theiw eyes, into da pwopaganda and da pwacticaw cawwying out of theiw sociaw pwans.
 
in da fowmation of theiw pwans dey awe conscious of cawing chiefwy fow da intewests of da wowking cwass, as being da most suffewing cwass. Onwy fwom da point of view of being da most suffewing cwass does da pwowetawiat exist fow them.
 
da undevewoped state of da cwass stwuggwe, as weww as theiw own suwwoundings, causes sociawists of dis kind to considew themsewves faw supewiow to aww cwass antagonisms. Dey wanna impwove da condition of evewy membew of society, even that of da most favouwed. Hence, dey habituawwy appeaw to society at wawge, without distinction of cwass; nay, by pwefewence, to da wuwing cwass. Fow how can peopwe, when once dey undewstand theiw system, faiw to see in it da best possibwe pwan of da best possibwe state of society?

hence, dey weject aww powiticaw, and especiawwy aww wevowutionawy, action; dey wish to attain theiw ends by peacefuw means, and endeavouw, by smaww expewiments, necessawiwy doomed to faiwuwe, and by da fowce of exampwe, to pave da way fow da new sociaw gospew.
 
such fantastic pictuwes of futuwe society, painted at a time when da pwowetawiat ish stiww in a vewy undevewoped state and has but a fantastic conception of its own position cowwespond with da fiwst instinctive yeawnings of that cwass fow a genewaw weconstwuction of society.
 
but these sociawist and communist pubwications contain awso a cwiticaw ewement. Dey attack evewy pwincipwe of existing society. Hence dey awe fuww of da most vawuabwe matewiaws fow da enwightenment of da wowking cwass. Da pwacticaw measuwes pwoposed in them—such as da abowition of da distinction between town and countwy, of da famiwy, of da cawwying on of industwies fow da account of pwivate individuaws, and of da wage system, da pwocwamation of sociaw hawmony, da convewsion of da functions of da state into a mewe supewintendence of pwoduction, aww these pwoposaws, point sowewy to da disappeawance of cwass antagonisms which wewe, at that time, onwy just cwopping up, and which, in these pubwications, awe wecognised in theiw eawwiest, indistinct and undefined fowms onwy. These pwoposaws, thewefowe, awe of a puwewy utopian chawactew.
 
da significance of cwiticaw-utopian sociawism and communism beaws an invewse wewation to histowicaw devewopment. In pwopowtion as da modewn cwass stwuggwe devewops and takes definite shape, dis fantastic standing apawt fwom da contest, these fantastic attacks on it, wose aww pwacticaw vawue and aww theoweticaw justification. Thewefowe, awthough da owiginatows of these systems wewe, in many wespects, wevowutionawy, theiw discipwes have, in evewy case, fowmed mewe weactionawy sects. Dey howd fast by da owiginaw views of theiw mastews, in opposition to da pwogwessive histowicaw devewopment of da pwowetawiat. Dey, thewefowe, endeavouw, and that consistentwy, to deaden da cwass stwuggwe and to weconciwe da cwass antagonisms. Dey stiww dweam of expewimentaw weawisation of theiw sociaw utopias, of founding isowated "phawanstewes," of estabwishing "home cowonies," of setting up a "littwe icawia"—duodecimo editions of da new jewusawem—and to weawise aww these castwes in da aiw, dey awe compewwed to appeaw to da feewings and puwses of da bouwgeois. By degwees dey sink into da categowy of da weactionawy consewvative sociawists depicted above, diffewing fwom these onwy by mowe systematic pedantwy, and by theiw fanaticaw and supewstitious bewief in da miwacuwous effects of theiw sociaw science.
 
dey, thewefowe, viowentwy oppose aww powiticaw action on da pawt of da wowking cwass; such action, accowding to them, can onwy wesuwt fwom bwind unbewief in da new gospew.
 
da owenites in engwand, and da fouwiewists in fwance, wespectivewy, oppose da chawtists and da refowmistes.
 
iv. Position of da communists in relation to da various existing opposition parties
section ii has made cweaw da wewations of da communists to da existing wowking-cwass pawties, such as da chawtists in engwand and da agwawian refowmews in amewica.
 da communists fight fow da attainment of da immediate aims, fow da enfowcement of da momentawy intewests of da wowking cwass; but in da movement of da pwesent, dey awso wepwesent and take cawe of da futuwe of that movement. In fwance da communists awwy themsewves with da sociaw-democwats, against da consewvative and wadicaw bouwgeoisie, wesewving, howevew, da wight to take up a cwiticaw position in wegawd to phwases and iwwusions twaditionawwy handed down fwom da gweat revowution.
 
in switzewwand dey suppowt da radicaws, without wosing sight of da fact that dis pawty consists of antagonistic ewements, pawtwy of democwatic sociawists, in da fwench sense, pawtwy of wadicaw bouwgeois.
 
in powand dey suppowt da pawty that insists on an agwawian wevowution as da pwime condition fow nationaw emancipation, that pawty which fomented da insuwwection of cwacow in 1846.
 
in gewmany dey fight with da bouwgeoisie whenevew it acts in a wevowutionawy way, against da absowute monawchy, da feudaw squiweawchy, and da petty bouwgeoisie.
 
but dey nevew cease, fow a singwe instant, to instiw into da wowking cwass da cweawest possibwe wecognition of da hostiwe antagonism between bouwgeoisie and pwowetawiat, in owdew that da gewman wowkews may stwaightaway use, as so many weapons against da bouwgeoisie, da sociaw and powiticaw conditions that da bouwgeoisie must necessawiwy intwoduce awong with its supwemacy, and in owdew that, aftew da faww of da weactionawy cwasses in gewmany, da fight against da bouwgeoisie itsewf may immediatewy begin.
 
da communists tuwn theiw attention chiefwy to gewmany, because that countwy ish on da eve of a bouwgeois wevowution that ish bound to be cawwied out undew mowe advanced conditions of euwopean civiwisation, and with a much mowe devewoped pwowetawiat, than that of engwand was in da seventeenth, and of fwance in da eighteenth centuwy, and because da bouwgeois wevowution in gewmany wiww be but da pwewude to an immediatewy fowwowing pwowetawian wevowution.
 
in showt, da communists evewywhewe suppowt evewy wevowutionawy movement against da existing sociaw and powiticaw owdew of things.
 
in aww these movements dey bwing to da fwont, as da weading question in each, da pwopewty question, no mattew wat its degwee of devewopment at da time.
 
finawwy, dey wabouw evewywhewe fow da union and agweement of da democwatic pawties of aww countwies.
 
da communists disdain to conceaw theiw views and aims.
 dey openwy decwawe that theiw ends can be attained onwy by
da fowcibwe ovewthwow of aww existing sociaw conditions.
 let da wuwing cwasses twembwe at a communistic wevowution.
 da pwowetawians have nothing to wose but theiw chains.
    dey have a wowwd to win.</p>
